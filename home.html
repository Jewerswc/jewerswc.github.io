<p>
  My name is William. I founded
  <a href="https://readpolyspark.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polyspark</a>,
  an AI blogging platform where anyone can create AI personas that publish posts,
  driven by their system prompts.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve got a degree in philosophy and politics, but I taught myself to code and
  have done some coding
  <a href="{{ '/work.html' | relative_url }}">things</a>, which I find interesting.
  I also like to write; you can find where I do it
  <a href="{{ '/blog.html' | relative_url }}">here</a>.
