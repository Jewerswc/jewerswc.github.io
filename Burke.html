  <h2 style="text-align: center;">BURKE’S THREE DOCTRINES AND THE FRENCH-ENGLISH QUESTION OF REFLECTIONS</h2>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An important and surprisingly untouched question of Burkean studies is whether and indeed how Burke used his anti-revolutionary on the French Revolution as a cat-call warning for England. An important question in Burkean studies that remains unanswered is how Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em> represent a commentary on French affairs and how far they represent an implicit commentary on English affairs. John Pocock proposes that this question can be answered through an understanding of two things. The derivation of three doctrines of Burke from English discourse or from his understanding of pre-Revolution France. ‘Monied interest’, this article shows, was a term originating from the Tory denunciation of Whigs during the rule of Queen Anne and, thus, can be understood in thoroughly English terms. Next, the author shows that ‘armed doctrine’ originated from Burke’s understanding of the last phase of ancien régime France, but that it was well received by Burke’s sympathetic English readers. Finally, I show that ‘dreadful energy’ was drawn from David Hume’s conceptions of enthusiasm.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Burke, Pocock, French Revolution, monied interest, armed doctrine, dreadful energy.</p>

  <p>Significant scholarly work has now been undertaken to consider the historiography of Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em>, other writings, and speeches.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> Despite historiographical advances in understanding the work of Burke, significant questions around the nature of his thought remain unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> In fact, John Pocock goes as far as the claim that ‘one of the most difficult questions in Burkean studies’ remains unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> This gap in the literature concerns how far Burke’s ‘writings on the French Revolution form a commentary on English [affairs] and how far on French affairs’.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> More specifically, how far were Burke’s anti-revolutionary writings grounded in a language existing in English discourse and how far a language derived from his understanding of France prior to the Revolution. This is a problem we term – for the purpose of brevity – the French-English question. It is a question implicitly established by Burke in the full title of his <em>‘Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris’</em>.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup> Given that the French-English question remains one of the most challenging historiographical questions of Burke’s work, it is curious that little scholarly work has addressed it. It is only Beales who contributes to the question through his conclusion that Burke’s recondite writings on the French monasteries in <em>Reflections</em> constitute a definite ‘commentary on the situation in France’ and, thus, constitute part of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>Pocock proposes a two-pronged framework to address the French-English question.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> The first prong consists of the investigation of the origins and reception of Burke’s three doctrines amongst his English readers. This demonstrates how far Burke was writing in a discourse common to his English readers and what the sources of that discourse were. Burke’s three doctrines, identified by Pocock, and around which this dissertation revolve, are ‘monied interest’, ‘armed doctrine’, and ‘dreadful energy’. The second prong calls for a study of Burke’s understanding of the last phase(s) of the ancien règime society of France. Naturally, a set of <em>Reflections</em> on the French Revolution could not entirely be constituted by English tropes, concepts, and preconceptions and, thus, must include information about France and what led to the Revolution. This article, therefore, represents a first attempt at the French-English question. We show that two of the three doctrines are a product of English discourse and the other – ‘armed doctrine’ – was a product of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France, has traces of English discourse within it.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a consequence of our claim is that Burke did indeed write about France in English terms praising England and denouncing France in English terms in a manner that appealed to the representatives of England.<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> This, therefore, significantly contributes to Harris’ claim that Burke intended to write an account of the English nation that he knew would align with a common understanding among its representatives in the Church, Monarchy, Universities, and other national institutions.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup> This ‘authenticated’ his account of England as experientially real by those who represented it, but also shows that his fears of France – expressed in English terms – were shared by those who ‘authenticated him’.</p>

  <p>It is, however, Skinner’s intentional contextualism that holds the key to establishing our claim that Burke wrote about events in France in terms which originated from English discourse events to sway his readers away from acts of imitation.<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup> The implicit discursive contextuality of the French-English question – where it can only be understood in terms of Burke’s position vis-à-vis England, France, and revolution – renders it incompatible with the perennial approach of historiography which seeks timeless answers to political questions from political texts. Whilst Burke’s opposition to revolution arose from his rejection of abstract reason,<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup> such an explanation of Burke obfuscates the context of his opposition to the events in France. The contextualist methodology should also be avoided because it regards political thought as a mere composite of the religious, social, political, and economic contexts in which a writer is ensconced. Again, the French-English question is incompatible with contextualism because it is unclear how Burke could have been ardently anti-revolution when plenty of Englishmen were sympathetic to the Jacobin cause. Skinner’s intentional contextualism – where all statements are ‘the embodiment of a particular intention, on a particular occasion, addressed to the solution of a particular problem’<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> – unlocks our thesis that Burke intended his three doctrines as a warning call to his English readers against the replication of French events in England. It is, therefore, only under Skinner’s methodology that the French-English question, and our claim, is rendered comprehensible.</p>

  <p>Finally, our argument considers each of Burke’s doctrine in sequence. In Chapter One we show that ‘monied interest’ originates from the censure of Whig Rule by Queen Anne Tories. Chapter Two then shows that ‘armed doctrine’ was a derivation of Burke’s understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘Men of Letters’, ‘philosophes’ and ‘monied interest’ in pre-Revolution France. Chapter Three shows that ‘dreadful energy’ had origins in the religious term of censure ‘enthusiasm’, which also curiously had origins in English discourse prior to the Revolution.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">I</h2>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The origins of monied interest in Queen Anne Toryism</h2>

  <p>Burke uses ‘landed’ and ‘monied’ interest as terms which illuminate pre-Revolution French society. Both terms, however, have English lineage. These antithetical terms were used by ‘Queen Anne Tories’ ‘thunder[ing] against Whig Rule as that of a monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup> It is ‘Queen Anne Tories’ such as Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke (1678-1751), and Charles Davenant (1656-1714) which Burke’s ‘language is drawn straight from’.<sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup> Although the ‘monied interest’ in England under Queen Anne aroused ‘fears that were shared by most of the landed gentry of the age’, our focus on Swift, Bolingbroke and Davenant is a result of the prominence of their writings on ‘monied interest’.</p>

  <p>In the discourse of Queen Anne, ‘monied interest’ denoted those who ‘invested capital in systems of public credit’ to provide stability following the Glorious Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ of England then, was ‘not trade but finance, not merchants but stockjobbers’ or more specifically, ‘the structure of public credit… which had been operating through the Bank of England and the national debt’.<sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ are cast in oppositional terms to the traditional, and politically hegemonic, ‘landed interest’ who feared – and whose advocates feared – a transference of power under Whig rule. This was a fear that was perhaps justified given the nascent hegemony of the ‘monied’ institutions of the Bank of England, the East India Company, and the Banks in the City of London.<sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup></p>

  <p>The ’monied interest’ sought political means of exerting influence, too. They found more ‘obscure ways’ of exerting their financial power, which included lobbying the Royal Court, the introduction of politically and personally advantageous parliamentary bills, and the placement of pressure on government through threats to remove Treasury funding.<sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup> The purpose of this Chapter, therefore, is to show how Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant drew on ideas of ‘monied interest’ to denounce Whig rule they saw as corrupt and dangerous, which in turn shows the ancestry of Burke’s ‘monied interest’ in English discourse which he applies to French revolutionaries.</p>

  <p>Pocock curiously alludes to an even earlier genesis of ‘monied interest’, despite his emphatic affirmation that it originated from the ‘Queen Anne Tories’.<sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup> Tory censures of ‘monied interest’ had distinctly Harringtonian undertones and were forged in neo-Harringtonian terms. The English political theorist and republican James Harrington (1611–1677) argued that property bestowed independence, and thus power must be distributed so as to not encroach on property. The neo-Harringtonians – Harrington’s eighteenth century adaptation – held that it was the English constitution that was a bulwark for propertied independence against arbitrary power, but only where a balance between Crown and Parliament existed.<sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ subverts this balance through ingratiating itself with the Court and the administration of the day.<sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup> This is something the ‘landed interest’ – given their propertied independence – did not feel the need to do. Harrington, thus, provided the basis for the claim that the utility of a ‘landed interest’ lay in their propertied independence. The neo-Harringtonian adopted and mobilised this argument to denounce the Crown’s power of Parliamentary patronage, or rather corruption.<sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup></p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Swiftian ‘monied interest’</h3>
  <p>Turning first, then, to Swift as a leading ‘Queen Anne Tory’ and literary figure, we should note first of all that he produced several political pamphlets and essays denouncing the ‘monied interest’. Cook goes so far as to claim that the terms ‘landed interest’ and ‘monied interest’ were ‘two opposing sets of terms that turn through Swift’s political tracts like a leitmotif’.<sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup> Perhaps the most notable of Swift’s pamphlets, however, was <em>The Conduct of Allies</em> (1711) where Swift censures the Whigs for protracting an extortionate war which was beneficial only to the ‘monied interest’ because they ‘had raised vast sums by trading with stocks and funds, and lending upon great interest and premiums; whose perpetual harvest is war’.<sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup> Swift was the ‘monied interest’ as ‘fond of war’ and so he entreaties them to ‘furnish out one campaign at their own charge’ because of the financial burden it placed on the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup> Swift expresses a similar sentiment in <em>The Examiner</em> (1710-1714), with a rebuke of the ‘great numbers [who] find their profit in prolonging the war’ and who are ‘Men quite different from any that were ever known before the Revolution’.<sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup> Most damningly, however, Swift reproaches the ‘monied interest’ who ‘overreach others much wiser than themselves’.<sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup> For Swift, this led the ‘monied interest’ to create what was ‘at first a corruption, [something that has] grown necessary and what every good subject must now fall in with’.<sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup> It was the ‘monied interest’s’ ‘fond[ness] of war’, which meant that ‘taxes were increased, and funds multiplied every year’.<sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup> With the ‘landed interest’ footing the bill of such taxation, Swift expressed sorrow that the power that ‘used to follow Land, is now gone over to Money’.<sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup></p>

  <p>Swift’s literary works, however, are more figuratively expressive of the anxiety he had about the rise of the ‘monied interest’ … [*TRUNCATED HERE to keep Part A within ~60 references*].</p>

  <!-- =============================================== -->
  <!--         CONTINUATION OF MAIN TEXT FROM PART A   -->
  <!-- =============================================== -->

  <p><strong>[Continuing after Part A’s truncation]</strong></p>

  <p>Swift’s literary works, however, are more figuratively expressive of the anxiety he had about the rise of the ‘monied interest’. Fiona Duncan’s article (2012) on Swift’s literary expression of this concern in his <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1726) is of much illuminative value in this regard. Juxtaposed against Swift’s fear that ‘a great Part of the Nation’s Money got into the Hands of those, who by their Birth, Education and Merit, could pretend no higher than to wear our Liveries’, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> serves as an idealised portrayal of the ‘landed interest’ as paragons of virtue and stability. Demonised, therefore, are the ‘monied interest’, driven by self-interest and incapable of preserving the social fabric of Lilliput. Typical of this self-interest is the instance of Gulliver being left to explain to his Master ‘what Motives could incite this Race of Lawyers’ to engage in ‘a confederacy on injustice, merely for the sake of injuring Fellow-Animals’. Of striking similarity to his descriptions of the ‘monied interest’ is how Gulliver was ‘at much pains to describe to him the use of Money’ as the ‘Yahoos thought they could never have enough of it to spend or save, as they found themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or avarice’.</p>

  <p>Luna also sheds light on the literary significance of Swift as providing aesthetic – if not satirical – form to the abstract financial revolutions in the systems of credit and banking. Luna points to the allegories in Swift’s <em>The Wonder of all the Wonders, That Ever the World Wondered at</em> (1721) as satirising the illusory elements of stockjobbery. Through Swift’s character of Schoit – the illusory torturer that causes no harm – Swift plays at the illusory nature of the money market, which was plagued by ‘imaginary expectations conjured by investment in the money markets’.<sup><a href="#ref61">61</a></sup> Yet, it is interesting to note, as Nicholson does, that Swift ‘acted the part of a ‘moneyed’ man, making loans on mortgages, investing in South Sea stock, and owning outright no land to speak of’.<sup><a href="#ref62">62</a></sup></p>

  <p>The apotheosis of the rebuke that Swift makes against the ‘monied interest’ is where there are clear traces of Harringtonian thought. In <em>The Advantages Proposed by Repealing the Sacramental Test</em> (1732) Swift praises the ‘landed interest’ as ‘those… whose private interest is united with the interest of their country, supposing them to be of equal understanding with the rest of their neighbours, will heartily wish that the nation should thrive’. A similar Harringtonian defence is also articulated by Swift’s King of Lilliput who believes that ‘whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together’.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bolingbroke, Walpole, and the ‘monied interest’</h3>
  <p>Turning, next, to the writer and politician Henry Bolingbroke who notably focuses his objection to the ‘monied interest’ on that of Robert Walpole (1676-1745) and Walpole’s ‘Robinocracy’. The ‘Robinocracy’ referred to by Bolingbroke was a censorious term for Walpole’s ‘sinister network of influence’. They shared an ‘intense animosity’ for one another that provided ‘the energy for English political life between 1725 and 1740’. Bolingbroke’s rebuke of Walpole’s ‘Robinocracy’ fell along two lines; first, the ‘Robinocracy’ fostered a corrupt interrelation with the ‘monied interest’ and second, the ‘Robinocracy’ levied tax to fund a war that was directly beneficial to the ‘monied interest’, but detrimental to the ‘landed interest’. Thus, Walpole was, the very symbol of a corrupt ‘monied interest’, that Bolingbroke, the ‘appropriate political philosopher of the declining gentry’, railed against.</p>

  <p>Bolingbroke’s first line of attack against the ‘Robinocracy’ was against its interrelation with the ‘monied interest’ and the corruption therein. The extent of the association of the ‘monied interest’ and the ‘Robinocracy’ meant that the main practice through which the ‘monied interest’ gained its wealth was that of public borrowing, which ‘represented one of the main pillars of “Robinocracy”’. Bolingbroke goes as far as suggesting that the link between the ‘monied interest’ and the ‘Robinarchy’ was near-on inextricable because ‘when funding has been so long in fashion… the greatest minister has the means of being the greatest stockjobber’. There were, however, corrupt practices, Bolingbroke argues, through which the ‘Robinocracy’ tempted the ‘monied interest’ and which Bolingbroke sets out in <em>The Craftsman</em> (1729). The first of which was ‘tying people down with Honours, Titles and Preferment’. Yet, some of the ‘monied interest’, he asserts, would even be ‘persuaded to prostitute themselves for the “lean reward of Hopes and Promises”; and others, more senseless than all of them, have sacrificed their principles and consciences to a set of party-names, without any meaning, or the vanity of appearing in favour at court’. Such was Bolingbroke’s censure of the association between the ‘monied interest’ and ‘Robinocracy’ that he censures the ‘Robinocrat’ as ruling ‘by money, the Root of all Evils… [and, the Robinocrat, who] founds his iniquitous Dominion in the Corruption of the People’.</p>

  <p>The second line of Bolingbroke’s attack emanated from the heavy burden of tax placed on the ‘landed interest’, which was of financial benefit to the ‘monied interest’. Indeed, Bolingbroke questions that which was ‘lain upon the landed interest during the whole time’ by the ‘Robinocracy’ to pay for war. Bolingbroke was further frustrated that the ‘landed interest’ had not at that time ‘meddled in the public funds and management of the Treasury’. Bolingbroke disapproved of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘Robinocracy’ to the extent that he saw the ‘moneyed interest being firmly established at this time… accustomed to make immense profit at the public expense’. Walpole in fact refused to lower the interest rate paid to the lenders of public borrowing, which held the ‘landed interest’ at the ransom of the ‘monied’.</p>

  <p>Bolingbroke also indicates his fear of the decline of the ‘landed interest’ because he saw that the position of the ‘new interest [that] has been created out of their fortunes, and a sort of property which was not known twenty years ago, is now increased to be almost equal to the terra-firma of our island’. In fact, in his <em>Letter to Sir William Windham</em>, Bolingbroke – like Swift – draws on neo-Harringtonian ideas to dismiss the ‘monied interest’. It was ‘[t]he proprietor of the land, and the merchant who brought riches home by the returns of foreign trade, had during two wars bore the whole immense load of the national expenses’. Bolingbroke saw, however, that the lenders of money, added ‘nothing to the common stock, throve by the public calamity, and contributed not a mite to the public charge’.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Davenant, the ‘Whig Junto’, and the ‘monied interest’</h3>
  <p>Turning, to Davenant the mercantilist economist, Tory politician, and pamphleteer. Davenant, like Bolingbroke, censured the ‘monied interest’ in indirect terms by focusing on the ‘Whig Junto’. The ‘Whig Junto’ was the class of leading Whigs that was comprised of the Whig governments of 1694 to 1699 and 1702 to 1710. Davenant’s censure of the ‘Junto Ministry’ was laid out in two publications. First established in <em>An Essay Upon Ways and Means of supplying the War</em> (1695), where Davenant expresses his concern for the ‘landed interest’ where he was concerned that where ‘high-land taxes, are long continued in a country little given to thrift as ours, the landed men must inevitably be driven into the hands of scriveners, citizens and usurers’. Davenant in fact questions the burden placed on the ‘landed interest’ and the lack thereof on the ‘monied interest’ because it seems that ‘London bears a sixth, [when] it ought to bear a half… [and] it has all the wealth; and the immoderate growth of that city undoes and ruins all the country’. Again, his concern for the ‘landed interest’ is reiterated in the statement that ‘all taxes, no matter of what sort, are always a tax on the land’ and that such taxes ‘will always lie heavily upon the landed men, as to make them concerned in Parliament, to continue such duties no longer than the necessity of war continues’.</p>

  <p>Davenant’s concerns about the ‘Junto Ministry’ and the ‘monied interest’ were further established in his <em>Discourses on the Publick Revenues and on the Trade of England</em> (1698). In these discourses, he raises objections to the long-term borrowing of money to finance government spending. He argued against the burden that such borrowing placed on commerce, trade, and the impact it would have on the ‘landed interest’ in servicing the debt and paying interest to the ‘monied interest’ (ibid.). In these writings, Davenant speaks of how ‘[w]e gratify the Mony’d men and usurers, who are the drones of the common-wealth, at the cost of the Landed Man’. Again, Davenant writes how ‘a loose administration in the King’s Revenues, is but a false way to popularity… and that to have the well and carefully administered may peradventure displease a few, but must relieve and satisfy the Landed Interest’. Davenant subjects the ‘monied interest’ to an ancient comparison where he considers that ‘[t]hey who stand possessed of the ready money, have in all times, and in all countries, given the law, and held the rest of the people in their power’. He sees that ‘the Romans were, more than once, constrained to rescue themselves, by force, from the fraud and oppression of the Mony’d men and usurers’. Thus, Davenant suggests that the actions of the ‘Whig Junto’, and indeed the very notion of ‘monied interest’, were of ancient lineage.</p>

  <p>Also of significance to Davenant’s rebuke of the ‘monied interest’ is his identification of the Duke of Marlborough as key figure in Whig corruption following the Glorious Revolution. It was Davenant who established Marlborough’s role in the practice of providing Whig figures with state rewards via pensions and advising these figures to then invest this money in the government where they would benefit from the returns. At the same time, this caused more taxes to be levied on the ‘landed interest’. The corruption that Davenant identified under Marlborough was the result of a ‘bloated state’ funded by the ‘landed interest’ where rewards meant that ‘Marlborough could dole out [money] to his Whig buddies’.</p>

  <p>From this analysis an interesting – although peripheral – question arises about Burke’s place in English discourse. Why did Burke, a Whig, use the seemingly anti-Whiggish notion of ‘monied interest’ to condemn the Revolutionary forces in France? This is question which Iain Hampshire-Monk addresses. Although Burke was a ‘fierce defender of Whig Principles’, party distinctions were a ‘discredited category’.<sup><a href="#ref63">63</a></sup> Thus, Burke’s opposition to the ’monied interest’ and support for the ‘landed interest’ is in this sense compatible with his Whiggery. Notably, Swift also operates in the antithetical terms of ‘landed interest’ and ‘monied interest’, disregarding notions of party interest or opposition.</p>

  <p>Whilst there is no clear evidence to suggest that Burke consciously adopted the term ‘monied interest’ from his Queen Anne Tory predecessors, he was aware of the works of Bolingbroke whom, for instance, he parodies in <em>A Vindication of Natural Society</em> (1756). It seems, however, that we can only claim that Burke subconsciously adopted this idea from the ‘Queen Anne Tories’. Of note, however, is the relation which the archetypal Burkean allegory of a dozen grasshoppers’ and ‘thousands of great cattle’ bears to a later statement by Swift. Like those listening to the grasshoppers, Swift saw the ‘[f]olly of too many, to mistake the Eccho of a London Coffee-house for the Voice of the Kingdom’.<sup><a href="#ref64">64</a></sup> Indeed, Burke’s denunciation of the French ‘monied interest’ heavily resonates with the denunciation of the Whig ‘monied interest’ by ‘Queen Anne Tories’.</p>

  <p>Burke’s own use of ‘monied interest’ corresponds with that of the ‘Queen Anne Tories’, except in its application. Burke applied ‘monied interest’ to French society and not English society, differentiating himself from the Queen Anne Tories. Like the ‘Queen Anne Tories’, the ‘monied’ and ‘landed’ interest were cast in oppositional terms by Burke who saw a ‘warfare between the noble ancient landed interest and the new monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref65">65</a></sup> Burke, again like the ‘Queen Anne Tories’, portrays the ‘monied interest’ as uninterested in the social fabric of the country, where instead they were ‘more ready for any adventure… [and] more disposed to new enterprises of any kind… [and those] who wish for change’.<sup><a href="#ref66">66</a></sup> Burke also writes of the ‘monied interest’ as ‘[t]he body of confiscators’ who acquired debtors through their lending of wealth, which is like the English ‘monied interest’s’ lending of wealth to the Treasury.</p>

  <p>It would be surprising if Burke was not – at least subconsciously – aware of the use of ‘monied interest’ by ‘Queen Anne Tories’. Whilst there is no evidence of a response to Burke’s denunciation of the French ‘monied interest’, there is evidence that suggests the doctrine was ubiquitous in English discourse immediately prior to the publication of Burke’s <em>Reflections</em>. A close contemporary of Burke, French Laurence, wrote to Burke that ‘Lord Fitzwilliam[‘s] speech and protest are preparing your way… [and] his reasons had made many converts at Batson’s amongst monied men’.<sup><a href="#ref67">67</a></sup></p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">II</h2>
  <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burke’s understanding of ancien régime France and ‘armed doctrine’</h2>

  <p>The unequivocal citation of ‘monied interest’ by Pocock as a doctrine which is ‘drawn straight from the vocabulary of Queen Anne Toryism’ is guidance to the French-English question that is not extended to ‘armed doctrine’.<sup><a href="#ref68">68</a></sup> This lack of guidance for ‘armed doctrine’ extends to the broader Burkean historiographical literature, and indeed the literature on Burke’s thought, which fails to cite ‘armed doctrine’ entirely. Where the literature does cite ‘armed doctrine’, however, it fails to provide the lineage of ‘armed doctrine’.</p>
  
  <p>The exception to this, however, is O’Brien’s attempt to trace ‘armed doctrine’ in French discourse. This, however, falsely leads him to dispute the validity of the doctrine. ‘Armed doctrine’ for O’Brien is ‘open to serious question’ because Bonaparte’s doctrine of ‘honour, glory and riches’ existed in French discourse contemporaneously with ‘armed doctrine’ and the two cannot have existed in the same linguistic space.<sup><a href="#ref69">69</a></sup> This claim, however, is methodologically erroneous for presupposing that Burke necessarily wrote about France in terms originating from French discourse. If, as we hypothesise, Burke is intending to vilify and minimise the linguistic effects of the French Revolution in England – as the methodology of Skinner’s intentional contextualism suggests – then it is unclear why Burke would draw ‘armed doctrine’ from French discourse, as O’Brien presupposes.</p>

  <p>The literature’s failure to cite ‘armed doctrine’ and an adherence to Pocock’s two-pronged framework suggests that it is the second prong of Pocock’s framework, where doctrines derive from Burke’s understanding of the last phase(s) of pre-Revolution France, which holds the explanation to the origins of ‘armed doctrine’.</p>

  <p>Beyond ‘armed doctrine’s’ lack of cited ancestry in English discourse, two further reasons suggest that ‘armed doctrine’ derived from Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France. First, Burke’s entitlement of <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> suggests the uncontroversial assumption that the authoring of such a text, which substantively focused on France, required a minimum requisite understanding of France to merit such a title. <em>Reflections</em>, as Pocock puts it, cannot merely be ‘the application of English bugaboos to French affairs’.<sup><a href="#ref70">70</a></sup> A second reason is that ‘armed doctrine’ – as the literature has suggested – is not present within English discourse. In fact, the doctrine lacks a clear referent within English, which is notable in light of the fact that England had their own Glorious Revolution a century prior. Burke establishes ‘armed doctrine’ as the ‘system, which, by its essence, is inimical to all other Governments’.<sup><a href="#ref71">71</a></sup> It is the circumstance where ‘[t]he state has dominion and conquest for its sole objects; the dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms’. Bourke succinctly summarises ‘armed doctrine’ as ‘a set of ideas (values)… [which receives] the backing of a state and army, and thus… [becomes] armed’.<sup><a href="#ref72">72</a></sup> There is no English event historically local to Burke where a doctrine under this definition received the backing of the English state and, thus, became armed. Even the Glorious Revolution, which Pocock claims encoded the English understanding of 1789, fails to provide a referent event.<sup><a href="#ref73">73</a></sup> 1688 was, for Burke, the restoration of the rightful Protestant line of succession and not the destruction of the English fabric. ‘Armed doctrine’ was analogous to wars of religious conquest such as that of Genghis Khan and the Prophet Mohamad who destroyed everything in their way in a manner contrary to nature.<sup><a href="#ref74">74</a></sup> It would have been contrary to cast 1688 in negative terms if ‘armed doctrine’ did originate from discourse around 1688. It is only Cromwell’s establishment of the Commonwealth and the Republicanism that undergirded it which has descriptive overlap with ‘armed doctrine’.<sup><a href="#ref75">75</a></sup> Yet there is no evidence to suggest this. ‘Armed doctrine’, therefore, lacks an ancestry in English discourse.</p>

  <p>This chapter, therefore, reconstructs Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France to show that ‘armed doctrine’ was a derivation of his understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘men of letters’ and the ‘monied interest’. We also show that ‘armed doctrine’ curiously received a warm reception amongst Burke’s readers, which suggests its existence in English discourse prior to Burke or that Burke successfully disseminated a common understanding of pre-Revolution France.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify">Burke’s understanding of ‘armed doctrine’ in ancien régime France (continued)</h3>
  <p>‘Armed doctrine’ is centred around the term ‘combination’, which Burke consistently uses in a pejorative manner throughout his writings. For Burke, it is only ‘bad men’ who are capable of ‘combination’. Indeed, this pejorative semantic change of ‘combination’ is prominently seen in the Burkean rallying-call, where Burke warns that ‘when bad men combine, the good must associate’. Burke’s reliance on English discourse is, however, shown – like Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant – by his positive rendering of the ‘landed interest’ as incapable of ‘combination’. The ‘very nature of a country life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupations and all the pleasures they afford’, Burke claims, makes ‘combination… impossible amongst country-people’ in France. Consequently, the act of ‘combination’ for Burke falls to the ‘monied interest’. Burke laments that ‘the power obtained by this revolution will settle… [amongst] the monied directors’. He also saw the ‘monied interest’ in France acquire power, like their counterparts in England, through the system of public credit to which they were creditors. Thus, he saw that via ‘the vast debt of France a great monied interest had insensibly grown up, and with it a great power’. The ‘monied interest’, however, resented the esteem of the ‘landed interest’ in France and, thus, their pride ‘not noble or newly noble, increased with its cause’. The ‘monied interest’ ‘felt with resentment an inferiority [against the landed interest], the grounds of which they did not acknowledge… [and there] was no measure to which they were not willing to lend themselves, in order to be revenged of the outrages of this rival pride’. Thus, a ‘warfare between the noble ancient landed interest, and the new monied interest’ existed, where the former possessed financial leverage over the state.</p>

  <p>The ‘combination’ also applied to a second group in France, who Burke saw as ‘a new description of men [that] had grown up’. These new men were ‘the political Men of Letters’. The ‘men of letters’ were a ‘literary cabal [who] had some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of Christian religion’. They were ‘philosophical fanatics who… do not scruple to avow their opinion, that a state can subsist without any religion better than with one’. Burke warned that all the ‘men of letters’ wanted was ‘the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into persecution which would strike at property, liberty, and life’. Thus, the ‘men of letters’ possessed a doctrine of atheism with which they sought to destroy the Christian religion. Indeed, when Burke visited Paris in 1773, he was struck by the atheism of the French salons where the ‘landed interest’, nobility, and aristocracy gathered, suggesting the doctrine’s successful dissemination. Burke saw that the ‘men of letters’ ‘cultivated, in a distinguished manner, the monied interest of France’. The ‘men of letters’ recognised that the ‘monied interest’ possessed a great influence and would ‘throw no small light upon the spirit of all their proceedings’. It was clear, therefore, to Burke that the ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ gave rise to an ‘armed doctrine’, which enabled the ‘monied interest’ a leverage over the state and the ‘men of letters’ a doctrine they could arm. Thus, the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ ‘combined’ against their respective enemies: the ‘landed interest’ and the Christian religion.</p>

  <p>Burke saw this ‘combination’ culminate in ‘armed doctrine’ through the ‘monied interest’s’ subversion of the state through the confiscation of the property of the French Church. Burke saw the ‘monied interest’s’ ownership of public debt, their animus towards the ‘landed interest’, and the motivation of the ‘men of letters’ to destroy Christian religion. The first step in this he saw as ‘nations… wading deeper and deeper into an ocean of boundless debt’. Naturally, the ‘monied interest’ looked ‘for their security in the fidelity of government’. Yet, when they were unable to find their security in ‘the fidelity of government’, they then turned and looked ‘to its power’. When this resulted, Burke saw ‘armed doctrine’ rear its head with the ‘monied interest’ striking ‘at the nobility through the crown and the church’ by confiscating Church property. The ‘monied interest’ wanted to strike at the ‘landed interest’ where they thought it would provoke the most destruction. They, therefore, struck them ‘on the side on which they thought them the most vulnerable… [which was] the possession of the church, which, through patronage of the crown, generally devolved on the nobility’. Where the ‘monied interest’ ‘found the clergy competent to incur a legal debt’, they confiscated church property. ‘Armed doctrine’, therefore, first arrived through the ‘monied interest’s’ confiscation of the Church. Burke views this confiscation of Church property motivated by the resentment of the ‘monied interest’ and the atheism of the ‘men of letters’.</p>

  <p>Turning to the meaning of ‘armed doctrine’, Burke wishes to show that the atheism of France was analogous to religious conquests. Burke saw the French Revolution and the atheism it propagated as analogous because they were events not known to have previously occurred in nature and ‘aimed at the destruction of nature itself’. Burke writes that the ‘landed interest’ in France ‘were found in such a situation as the Mexicans were, when they were attacked by the dogs, the cavalry, the iron and the gunpowder, of a handful of bearded men, whom they did not know to exist in nature’. An event, similarly, unknown to be prior in history, was that of ‘the power by which Mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the world’ and whom ‘in not much longer space of time than I have lived, overturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an empire from the Indus to the Pyrenees’. Burke also asks what the world ‘had to dread from Jinghiz Khan, upon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest Tartary, from whence first issued that scourge of the human race?’. The confiscation of the French Church for the purpose of destroying the Christian religion was, therefore, what Burke wished to show had not previously occurred in nature before and in that sense was akin to religious conquest.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify;">The English reception of ‘armed doctrine’</h3>
  <p>Turning, next, to the reception of ‘armed doctrine’ amongst Burke’s readers, the prevalence of the doctrine and its widespread reception suggests one of two things. First, either, ‘armed doctrine’ was already established in English discourse prior to Burke’s use of it, or second, Burke was competent at propagating an understanding of pre-Revolution France through his writings. Scant evidence exist for both claims, but we assert that the first is less plausible than the second given the discursive isolation of ‘armed doctrine’, which only appears in Burke’s sole use of the term in LRP.</p>

  <p>Loussouarn’s superb paper on ‘Gillray and the French Revolution’ shows the artistic reception of ‘armed doctrine’. Loussouarn shows the ‘Burkean instinct’ of the prominent caricaturist and printmaker James Gillray (1756-1815), who captured ‘armed doctrine’ in artistic means. Gillray’s ‘Promis'd Horrors of the French Invasion’ (1796) represents ‘armed doctrine’, serving to warn English society of the ‘Promis’d Horrors’ if the ills of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ spread to England. Gillray’s caricature is an apocalyptic depiction of the scene where the French Nation in Arms is led down St James’ Street by the Whig Politician, and sympathiser of the French Revolution, Charles James Fox (1749-1806). In this scene, St James’ Palace is ablaze and a tray of decapitated heads ‘killed off for the public good’ (Gillray, 1796) sit beside a guillotine on the balcony of Brookes’s, the London Club of Whigs. Typifying Gillray’s ‘Burkean instinct’, Gillray depicts the French Revolutionaries overtaking Whites – the Club which is the bastion of British conservatism. A figure in the corner of the caricature – presumably a member of the ‘monied interest’ – is carrying bags containing ‘requisition from the Bank of England’ and ‘remains of the Treasury’, where the ‘monied interest’ has subverted the state and repossessed its credit. Thus, Gillray has translated the events of France and ‘armed doctrine’ artistically into English terms, with Fox as a member of the ‘men of letters’ and the ‘monied interest’ leveraging the state. Gillray also references ‘armed doctrine’ in his caricature ‘Smelling out a Rat; or the Atheistical-Revolutionist disturbed in his Midnight “Calculations”’ (1790). Richard Price (1723-1791), Burke’s opponent, whom he addresses in <em>Reflections</em>, is depicted as writing a pamphlet ‘On the Benefits of anarchy & atheism’, the ruling doctrine of the ‘men of letters’. Representing Burke disrupting ‘armed doctrine’, Price is disturbed by two hands with one holding the crown of the Monarchy and the other the crucifix of the Church.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, such was the force of Burke’s ‘armed doctrine’ that it was drawn on in English discourse, not only after his death, but after the end of the French Revolution. The Irish politician Henry Grattan (1746-1820) alluded to ‘armed doctrine’ in the House of Commons, where he spoke of ‘a tyranny founded on the triumph of the army over the principles of civil government, tending to universalize throughout Europe the domination of the sword’. Grattan also extended his concern of the doctrine’s spread to Ulster where he warns the Irish to ‘touch not this plant of Gallic growth; its taste is death, though 'tis not the tree of knowledge’.</p>

  <p>The use of ‘armed doctrine’ by William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) presents a significant affirmation of the claim that Burke wrote <em>Reflections</em> with conceptions of England and France that would be recognised by representatives of the English nation, so as to be ‘authenticated’ by them. Pitt admired Burke’s antipathy to the French Revolution and he ‘employed language in debate [that was] hardly distinguishable from, sometimes a direct echo of, Burke’s phraseology’. Pitt’s Speech to the House of Commons in June 1799 references an England at ‘war with… armed opinions’. The adoption of ‘armed doctrine’ by Pitt was not immediate, however, because he initially ‘went to war: but he did not understand the peculiar nature of that war’. His later vehemence suggests that Burke’s ‘armed doctrine’ was indeed ‘authenticated’ when in 1803 Pitt spoke of the ‘liquid fire of Jacobinal principles desolating the world’. Thus, Pitt’s adoption of ‘armed doctrine’ vindicated Burke’s intention of using English discourse to construct an understanding of France which warned against the revolution.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">III</h2>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Dreadful Energy</h2>

  <p>The existence of ‘dreadful energy’, like ‘armed doctrine’, is confined to Burke’s sole use of the term in his LRP. Also like ‘armed doctrine’, the historiographical literature on ‘dreadful energy’ fails to suggest that the term has ancestry in English discourse. ‘Dreadful energy’, therefore, has a scant existence in English discourse.</p>

  <p>The resemblance of ‘dreadful energy’ to the term ‘enthusiasm’ is, however, striking. ‘Enthusiasm’ enjoyed prevalence in English discourse prior to and at the time of Burke’s writings and is a term also present in Burke’s work. ‘Enthusiasm’, anachronistically, refers to a religious fervour of the individual captured by the divine or possessed with a religious spirit. ‘Dreadful energy’, on the other hand, refers to the circumstance ‘where nothing rules but the mind of desperate men’ and the ‘spectacle of human energy disengaged from any system of property relationships whatever’. If ‘Enthusiasm’ is translated into the terms of ‘dreadful energy’, then it is the spectacle of religious energy disengaged from any system of ecclesiastical relationship whatever and, therefore, ‘dreadful energy’ shares a secularised synonymy with ‘enthusiasm’.</p>

  <p>O’Neill suggests that Burke understood this resemblance of meaning, too. O’Neill demonstrates that Burke established the resemblance ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’ himself, claiming that those ‘who have made but superficial studies in the Natural History of the human mind’ have understood ‘religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal, and sectarian propagation’. This for Burke was a mistake because ‘there is no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the very same effect’ and man’s ‘social nature… impels him to propagate his principles’. Thus, we see that ‘dreadful’ energy is an atheistic ‘enthusiasm’ or an ‘energy, restrained by no consideration of God or man’ (Burke, 1797).</p>

  <p>Pocock provides support in establishing the synonymy by inserting Burke into a hypothetical dialogue with Karl Marx. In this ‘dialogue of the dead’, Karl Marx explains to Burke that ‘dreadful energy’ is merely the replacement of ‘one system of property relationship’ with another. Pocock asserts that Burke would reply to Marx by deprecating him as another ‘learned and ingenious speculator’ that had failed ‘to recognize the spectacle of human energy disengaged from any system of property relationships whatever’. Thus, ‘dreadful energy’, like ‘enthusiasm’, is ‘the spectacle of human energy disengaged’ from the world in which it is located.</p>

  <p>Although Pocock answers the French-English question vis-à-vis ‘enthusiasm’ and shows that Burke ‘redefined’ ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to speak of the energy of French revolutionaries, he curiously fails to draw the link between ‘dreadful energy’ and ‘enthusiasm’. Given that Pocock identified ‘dreadful energy’ seven years prior as pivotal to the French-English question, it is unclear why he failed to explicitly demonstrate the link between ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’ when it held an answer to what he called one of the most challenging questions around Burke’s work.</p>

  <p>This chapter, therefore, rectifies the failure of Pocock to link the synonymy of ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’, showing that ‘dreadful energy’ – via ‘enthusiasm’ – possessed a lineage in English discourse. To this end, we first reconstruct Pocock’s argument that Burke ‘redefined’ ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to then apply it to descriptions of French revolutionaries. We then show, with reference to Carroll’s ‘revisitation’ of Burke’s ‘enthusiasm’, that, instead of adopting ‘enthusiasm’, Burke coined ‘dreadful energy’. He coined ‘dreadful energy’ to describe the events in France as atheistic and <em>sui generis</em> in history and so it required a new term to delineate it as something never before seen in English history. We then show that the lack of response ‘dreadful energy’ receives from Burke’s readers either suggests that it was understood as a superfluous term for ‘enthusiasm’ or that Burke failed to convey the term’s meaning.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify">Burke’s ‘redefinition’ of ‘enthusiasm’</h3>
  <p>We first turn to Pocock’s argument that Burke transposed the English idea of ‘enthusiasm’ onto what he saw as the intellectual energies driving the French Revolution. Pocock makes this claim in his chapter on ‘Edmund Burke and the Redefinition of Enthusiasm: the Context as Counter-Revolution’. The reconstruction of Pocock’s ‘redefinition’ requires, first, evidence that ‘enthusiasm’ existed in English discourse and, second, evidence that Burke saw a similar phenomenon in France.</p>

  <p>The term ‘enthusiasm’ enjoyed relative ubiquity in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English discourse following the Glorious Revolution and the Interregnum where it was used to denounce religious fanatics captured by a religious spirit. Goldstein establishes that the prevalence of ‘enthusiasm’ in English discourse at this time is incontestable, citing several prominent publications and statements on the phenomenon. The first publication on ‘enthusiasm’ was by the English philosopher Henry More (1614-1687), who wrote <em>A Brief Discourse of The Nature, Causes, Kinds, and Cure of Enthusiasm</em>. More was concerned about the prominence of ‘enthusiasm’, such that he warns that if ‘ever Christianity be exterminated, it will be by Enthusiasm’. More also proved influential to Burke, who Carroll cites as influencing Burke through his <em>Enthusiamus Triumphatus</em> (1656), which provides the source of Burke’s own suspicions around ‘enthusiasm’. The philosopher and physician John Locke (1632-1704) also developed an influential critique of ‘enthusiasm’ warning against the individual ‘so dim… as to take monsters lodged in his own brain for the images of the Deity’. The eighteenth-century writer Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) also indicates the commonness of ‘enthusiasm’ via his definition of ‘enthusiasm’ in his <em>Dictionary of the English language</em>, defining the term as the ‘vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication’ (1755). The Third Earl of Shaftesbury (1671-1713) also provides a stark condemnation of ‘enthusiasm’ in his <em>Letter Concerning Enthusiasm</em>, where, along Burkean lines, he writes how ‘divine inspiration is a real feeling of the divine presence, and atheistic enthusiasm is a false one’. Even Burke’s adversary, the chemist and philosopher, Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), wrote of the vanity and self-involvement of ‘enthusiasm’ as making one ‘imagine that we are the peculiar favourites of the divinity’.</p>

  <p>It was under England’s own revolution of 1688 that ‘enthusiasm’ burgeoned, further supporting the claim that ‘dreadful energy’ was a derivation of ‘enthusiasm’. ‘Enthusiasm’ was the preserve of esoteric religious sects and groups who arose during the Interregnum where, under dissolved government, conditions for social and religious dissent were appropriate. It was the nearest thing that the English had to a ‘revolutionary consciousness’. In England, however, ‘enthusiasm’ never gained revolutionary traction because it was located in a discourse of toleration. ‘Enthusiasm’ was tolerated, but not encouraged like ‘dreadful energy’. Protestant dissenters received further toleration during the Glorious Revolution, which enabled ‘enthusiasm’ to burgeon. Prior to 1688, James II made a bid for the support of nonconformists in England to shore up support for Catholicism. This move alongside the birth of his Catholic heir and his libel of seven Protestant Bishops precipitated his deposition and the installation of William of Orange, securing the Protestant religion in England. The removal of James II undermined the toleration offered by James II to Protestant Dissenters and Nonconformists, however. The Anglican Church-state, therefore, made a bid to secure the support of Dissenters and Nonconformists via further acts of religious toleration. The Toleration Act of 1689 was introduced, therefore, to enshrine the freedom of worship in law for Nonconformists, excepting Roman Catholics, but still excluding them from offices of the Crown and posts at universities. Dissenters also began to claim that 1688 re-affirmed their civil liberties through an act of the will of the people and, thus, all people, regardless of religion, possessed civil liberties. Religion in England, therefore, was coming to be identified with freedom of religion or the freedom to search for religious beliefs – ‘enthusiasm’.</p>

  <p>There is also evidence that Burke was aware of the term ‘enthusiasm’. He used ‘enthusiasm’ to chastise his critics. For example, he censured the chemist and philosopher Joseph Priestley for seeing everything ‘in their constitution and government at home… as illegitimate and usurped, or at best as a vain mockery’. Priestley’s disdain for everything at home, Burke claims, led him to look ‘abroad with an eager and passionate enthusiasm’. Burke also used the term to ridicule the ‘famous sermon of the Old Jewry’ given by his adversary Richard Price whose ‘enthusiasm kindles as he advances; and when he arrives at his peroration it is in a full blaze’.</p>

  <p>We turn, next, to establish Burke’s identification of ‘enthusiasm’ in France. There existed a curious semantic overlap between the openness of belief that was seen under English Unitarian theology and the ‘electrick communication’ – ‘transparence’ – of the ‘men of letters’ that Burke saw in France. Pocock makes clear that it was ‘in Unitarian theology… [that] we find the nearest approach to a Rousseauist transparence to be discoverable in the English discourse of the years before the French Revolution’. Locke, who was alleged to be a rational and Unitarian dissenter, was accused of ‘transparence’. The Welsh economist and political writer Josiah Tucker (1713-1799) labelled Locke as an ‘honest, undissembling Rousseau’. Locke was a spearhead of arguments for increased religious toleration following 1688, which he saw to affirm the religious rights of all. Although ‘enthusiasm’ in England was limited by its location in a discourse of toleration, under ‘transparence’ in France there was no ‘means of arresting a principle in its course’ and, thus, ‘dreadful energy’ flourished. Burke, therefore, identifies an inclination towards transparency in both England and France, which enables the ‘enthusiasm’ that he sees in England and ‘dreadful energy’ in France.</p>

  <p>Pocock’s characterisation of Burke’s drawing on English discourse – particularly vis-à-vis 1688 – to inform English understandings of the French revolution further supports the claim that Burke drew on ‘enthusiasm’ to inform the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw in France. English discourse was averse towards the ‘sovereignty of self-creating discourse’ seen in France. This is indicated by the basis from which Burke’s discussion of the French Revolution came about: was the French Revolution seen as the same kind as 1688 and could English discourse capture it? Burke’s <em>Reflections</em> was written in response to Richard Price’s sermon ‘On the Love of Our Country’, which was given by Price 101 years after 1688. Both <em>Reflections</em> and Price’s sermon, therefore, were a ‘renewed discussion of the English Revolution a century before’. What is also clear is that the French Revolution was capable of creating ‘renewals and even innovations’ in English discourse, but it was incapable of recreating English discourse entirely or placing within it a revolutionary discourse.</p>

  <p>‘Enthusiasm’ was encoded into English discourse with negative connotations to the extent that a rejection of ‘enthusiasm’ was seen as a necessary part of the defence of the Whig order. Such was the case that David Hume (1711-1776) and Adam Smith (1723-1790) offered critiques of ‘enthusiasm’, which defended this Whig order. Further reinforcing the idea that ‘transparence’ or ‘enthusiasm’ were encoded by English discourse is Burke’s own statement of ‘dreadful energy’ where he casts the ‘dreadful energy’ of the French Jacobins in terms of an English character. Burke draws on James Harrington, the ‘learned and ingenious speculator’, casting Harrington as an English Jacobin – or the closest thing to it – and makes clear that what happened in France is even something that Harrington ‘who has tossed about society into all forms, never could imagine to be possible’. Thus, even Burke’s representation of the French Jacobin is encoded by English discourse and in this case an example of an English radical. Burke did not want the Revolution explained out of a concern for its normalisation and to speak of the French Jacobins in their own terms would have been to do just that.</p>

  <p>It remains unclear, however, why Burke did not label the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw in France as that of the ‘enthusiasm’ he saw in England. We suggest – via Carroll – that the ‘dreadful energy’ Burke witnessed was <em>sui generis</em> in history and, thus, Burke wanted to retain the meaning of ‘enthusiasm’ but de-couple the term from English discourse so as to prevent its spread in England. Carroll disputes Pocock’s interpretation that Burke saw the ‘enthusiasm’ in France as merely redolent of that present in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. Carroll argues that Burke regarded ‘enthusiasm’ as a ‘revolution of moral psychology’, where the Jacobin no longer regards their actions of ‘enthusiasm’ with shame. This was of acute concern to Burke because ‘enthusiasm’ in England was understood to dissipate after time, but Burke feared that the fervour of the ideological zealot did not, thus constituting a new ‘dreadful energy’.</p>

  <p>The emotional temper of Burke’s response also suggests that he saw the ‘dreadful energy’ in France as different from mere religious ‘enthusiasm’. In the course of Burke’s denunciation of the events he saw in France and of the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw, he was himself accused of ‘enthusiasm’. The English philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) accused Burke of lacking a reasoned opposition to the doctrine of the rights of man, which had gained intellectual currency in France. Rather she accused Burke of rejecting the rights of man from a position of mere ‘romantic enthusiasm’. Such was the prevalence of concern for Burke’s ‘enthusiasm’ against the French Revolution that his parliamentary colleagues warned that if he failed to control himself, they would have him committed as a madman. Burke rejected such accusations and claimed that he was ‘no enthusiast’, but rather ‘a sober and reflecting man’.</p>

  <p>Turning, finally, to the reception of ‘dreadful energy’. ‘Dreadful energy’ received relatively little reception from Burke’s contemporaries. This suggests that either Burke failed to disseminate the doctrine or that it proved superfluous in light of its resemblance to ‘enthusiasm’. The traceable reception that it did receive was not from a fellow traveler of anti-Jacobinism, however. John Thelwall (1764-1834), a political orator and writer, who had previously written a <em>Sober Reflections on the Seditious and Inflammatory Letter of the Rt. Hon. Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord</em>, left traces of the doctrine in his book <em>The Rights of Nature against the Usurpations of Establishments</em>. Almost adopting ‘dreadful energy’ and attempting to couch it in positive terms, Thelwall writes that the ‘new opinion prevailed, because there is an incalculable distance between the energy and enthusiasm of a new conviction, and the science and mechanism of ancient habits’ (1796, p. 75).</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">IV</h2>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The three doctrines cited by Pocock from Burke’s <em>Reflections</em> and LRP have complex origins, with ancestries more-so in English discourse than in Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France. Whilst further exploration of the French-English question and, indeed, Burke’s three doctrines would benefit this area of Burkean studies, this work answers the question posed by Pocock 41 years ago regarding the extent to which Burke’s work represents a commentary on English affairs or that of a commentary on French affairs.</p>

  <p>An affirmation is also provided to Pocock’s previous works, which hint at answers to the French-English question. First, Section One shows that ‘monied interest’ possesses a lineage from the works of Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant, affirming Pocock’s assertion that the doctrine was indeed part of the language of Queen Anne Tories. Chapter Three draws a crucial link between ‘dreadful energy’ and ‘enthusiasm’ and, thus, shows the English origins of ‘dreadful energy’ because Burke transposed ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to his descriptions of France. Chapter Two represents an anomaly vis-à-vis Chapter One and Three because ‘armed doctrine’ is a derivation of Burke’s understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ in pre-Revolution France. We also show, however, that Burke described his understanding of pre-Revolution France in English terms, such as ‘monied interest’. ‘Armed doctrine’ also represents a curious discursive anomaly with a significant positive reception in English discourse following Burke’s employment of the doctrine. This either represents Burke’s accomplished propagation of the doctrine or a pre-existing understanding of its meaning, and thus pre-Revolution France, amongst his English readers.</p>

  <p>A significant contribution is also made by this work to Harris’ claim that Burke wrote in a language that was intended to appeal to the representatives of the English nation and when they warmly affirmed his account of the English nation his work was ‘authenticated’. Chapter One shows that Burke drew on ‘monied interest’, which was already present in English discourse, to appeal to the critics of ‘monied interest’ at home in denouncing a section of pre-Revolution French society. Chapter Two also contributes to Harris’ thesis, despite ‘armed doctrine’s’ ostensible non-English origins. ‘Armed doctrine’ received the largest traceable reception with a clear affirmation from the leader of the nation at that time – Pitt the Younger. Chapter Three shows that, whilst ‘dreadful energy’ failed to receive much attention from Burke’s readers, the doctrine was likely a guise for ‘enthusiasm’ which had prominence of English discourse prior to and following Burke. Further research on the reception of ‘enthusiasm’ would, therefore, benefit this area.</p>

  <p>Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ also elicit the notion that Burke possessed the intention of warning his English readers away from the revolutionary events in France. This corresponds with Blakemore’s claim that Burke saw the French Revolution as a linguistic event that risked emptying English discourse and filling it instead with words and phrases of revolution. Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ shows his diligence in preserving terms which had historical significance in English discourse and which Burke may have feared would be destroyed by the ‘sovereignty of self-creating discourse’ that existed in France.</p>

  <p>Burke’s reputation as an opponent of the French Revolution is distinctly reaffirmed and shown as an underpinning intention of his <em>Reflections</em> and LRP. He uses the doctrines of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ to illustrate that dangers previously existing in England after 1688, were alive in France in all new kinds. Even his understanding of pre-Revolution France is constructed in English terms. For instance, ‘armed doctrine’ is a ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ – which Queen Anne Tories knew in England – and others. The depth of discursive encoding from 1688 at play in Burke’s work is, therefore, touched upon by his three doctrines. The intention of Burke’s writing of <em>Reflections</em> and his LRP is paramount to the French-English question and we have shown that his three doctrines are a set of cunning linguistic moves focused at keeping away the ‘Colossus which bestrides our channel’ (LRP, p. 76).</p>
