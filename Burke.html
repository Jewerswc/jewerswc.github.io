    <h2 style="text-align: center;">BURKE’S THREE DOCTRINES AND THE FRENCH ENGLISH QUESTION OF REFLECTIONS</h2>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An important and surprisingly untouched question in Burkean studies is whether and indeed how Burke used his anti-revolutionary writings on the French Revolution as a cat-call warning for England. An important question in Burkean studies that remains unanswered is how Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em> represent a commentary on French affairs and how far they represent an implicit commentary on English affairs. John Pocock proposes that this question can be answered through an understanding of two things: the derivation of three doctrines of Burke from English discourse or from his understanding of pre-Revolution France. ‘Monied interest’<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> was a term originating from the Tory denunciation of Whigs during the rule of Queen Anne and thus can be understood in thoroughly English terms. Next, ‘armed doctrine’<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> originated from Burke’s understanding of the last phase of ancien régime France, but it was well received by Burke’s sympathetic English readers. Finally, ‘dreadful energy’<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> was drawn from David Hume’s conceptions of enthusiasm.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Burke, Pocock, French Revolution, monied interest, armed doctrine, dreadful energy.</p>

    <p>Significant scholarly work has now been undertaken to consider the historiography of Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em>, other writings, and speeches.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> Despite historiographical advances in understanding Burke’s work, significant questions around the nature of his thought remain unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup> In fact, John Pocock goes as far as to claim that ‘one of the most difficult questions in Burkean studies’ remains unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> This gap in the literature concerns how far Burke’s ‘writings on the French Revolution form a commentary on English [affairs] and how far on French affairs’.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> More specifically, how far were Burke’s anti-revolutionary writings grounded in a language existing in English discourse and how far a language derived from his understanding of France prior to the Revolution. This is what we term – for the purpose of brevity – the French-English question. It is a question implicitly established by Burke in the full title of his <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris</em>.<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Given that the French-English question remains one of the most challenging historiographical questions of Burke’s work, it is curious that little scholarly work has addressed it. Only Beales contributes to the question through his conclusion that Burke’s recondite writings on the French monasteries in <em>Reflections</em> constitute a definite ‘commentary on the situation in France’ and thus part of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>Pocock proposes a two-pronged framework to address the French-English question.<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup> The first prong consists of the investigation of the origins and reception of Burke’s three doctrines among his English readers. This demonstrates how far Burke was writing in a discourse common to his English readers and what the sources of that discourse were. Burke’s three doctrines, identified by Pocock and around which this article revolves, are ‘monied interest’, ‘armed doctrine’, and ‘dreadful energy’. The second prong calls for a study of Burke’s understanding of the last phase(s) of the ancien régime society of France. Naturally, a set of <em>Reflections</em> on the French Revolution could not be constituted entirely by English tropes, concepts, and preconceptions, and thus must include information about France and what led to the Revolution. This article, therefore, represents a first attempt at the French-English question. We show that two of the three doctrines are a product of English discourse and that the other – ‘armed doctrine’ – was a product of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France, though it has traces of English discourse within it.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, a consequence of our claim is that Burke did indeed write about France in English terms, praising England and denouncing France in English terms in a manner that appealed to the representatives of England.<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup> This significantly contributes to Harris’ claim that Burke intended to write an account of the English nation that he knew would align with a common understanding among its representatives in the Church, Monarchy, Universities, and other national institutions.<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> This ‘authenticated’ his account of England as experientially real by those who represented it, but also shows that his fears of France – expressed in English terms – were shared by those who ‘authenticated him’.</p>

    <p>It is, however, Skinner’s intentional contextualism that holds the key to establishing our claim that Burke wrote about events in France in terms which originated from English discourse events to sway his readers away from acts of imitation.<sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup> The implicit discursive contextuality of the French-English question – where it can only be understood in terms of Burke’s position vis-à-vis England, France, and revolution – renders it incompatible with the perennial approach of historiography which seeks timeless answers to political questions from political texts. Whilst Burke’s opposition to revolution arose from his rejection of abstract reason,<sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup> such an explanation of Burke obfuscates the context of his opposition to the events in France. The contextualist methodology should also be avoided because it regards political thought as a mere composite of the religious, social, political, and economic contexts in which a writer is ensconced. Again, the French-English question is incompatible with contextualism because it is unclear how Burke could have been ardently anti-revolution when plenty of Englishmen were sympathetic to the Jacobin cause. Skinner’s intentional contextualism – where all statements are ‘the embodiment of a particular intention, on a particular occasion, addressed to the solution of a particular problem’<sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup> – unlocks our thesis that Burke intended his three doctrines as a warning call to his English readers against the replication of French events in England. It is, therefore, only under Skinner’s methodology that the French-English question, and our claim, is rendered comprehensible.</p>

    <p>Finally, our argument considers each of Burke’s doctrines in sequence. In Chapter One, we show that ‘monied interest’ originates from the censure of Whig Rule by Queen Anne Tories. Chapter Two shows that ‘armed doctrine’ was a derivation of Burke’s understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘Men of Letters’, ‘philosophes’, and ‘monied interest’ in pre-Revolution France. Chapter Three shows that ‘dreadful energy’ had origins in the religious term of censure ‘enthusiasm’, which also had origins in English discourse prior to the Revolution.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">I</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">The origins of monied interest in Queen Anne Toryism</h2>

    <p>Burke uses ‘landed’ and ‘monied’ interest as terms which illuminate pre-Revolution French society. Both terms, however, have English lineage.<sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup> These antithetical terms were used by ‘Queen Anne Tories’ who ‘thunder[ed] against Whig Rule as that of a monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup> It is ‘Queen Anne Tories’ such as Jonathan Swift, Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, and Charles Davenant from whom Burke’s ‘language is drawn straight’.<sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup> Although the ‘monied interest’ in England under Queen Anne aroused ‘fears that were shared by most of the landed gentry of the age’, our focus on Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant results from the prominence of their writings on ‘monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup></p>

    <p>In the discourse of Queen Anne, ‘monied interest’ denoted those who ‘invested capital in systems of public credit’ to provide stability following the Glorious Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ of England then, was ‘not trade but finance, not merchants but stockjobbers’ or more specifically ‘the structure of public credit… which had been operating through the Bank of England and the national debt’.<sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ are cast in oppositional terms to the traditional, and politically hegemonic, ‘landed interest’ who feared a transference of power under Whig rule.<sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup> This was perhaps justified given the nascent hegemony of the ‘monied’ institutions of the Bank of England, the East India Company, and the City Banks.<sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup></p>

    <p>The ‘monied interest’ sought political means of exerting influence, too. They found more ‘obscure ways’ of exerting their financial power, including lobbying the Royal Court, introducing personally advantageous parliamentary bills, and placing pressure on government through threats to remove Treasury funding.<sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup> The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to show how Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant drew on ideas of ‘monied interest’ to denounce Whig rule they saw as corrupt and dangerous, which in turn shows the ancestry of Burke’s ‘monied interest’ in English discourse, applied to French revolutionaries.</p>

    <p>Pocock alludes to an even earlier genesis of ‘monied interest’, despite affirming it originated from the ‘Queen Anne Tories’. Tory censures of ‘monied interest’ had Harringtonian undertones, forged in neo-Harringtonian terms. James Harrington argued that property bestowed independence, and thus power must be distributed without encroachment on property. The neo-Harringtonians held that the English constitution was a bulwark for propertied independence against arbitrary power, but only where a balance between Crown and Parliament existed.<sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ subverts this balance by ingratiating itself with the Court and the administration. Harrington provided the basis for the claim that the utility of a ‘landed interest’ lay in their propertied independence. The neo-Harringtonians adopted this to denounce the Crown’s power of Parliamentary patronage (corruption).<sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Swiftian ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Swift, as a leading ‘Queen Anne Tory’ and literary figure, produced several political pamphlets and essays denouncing the ‘monied interest’. Cook claims the terms ‘landed interest’ and ‘monied interest’ were ‘two opposing sets of terms that turn through Swift’s political tracts like a leitmotif’.<sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup> Perhaps the most notable is <em>The Conduct of the Allies</em> (1711), where Swift censures the Whigs for protracting a war beneficial only to the ‘monied interest’ who ‘had raised vast sums by trading with stocks and funds, and lending upon great interest and premiums; whose perpetual harvest is war’.<sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup> Swift saw the ‘monied interest’ as ‘fond of war’ and entreaties them to ‘furnish out one campaign at their own charge’ because of the financial burden on the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup> In <em>The Examiner</em> (1710-1714), he rebukes the ‘great numbers [who] find their profit in prolonging the war’, ‘Men quite different from any ever known before the Revolution’.<sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup> Most damningly, Swift reproaches the ‘monied interest’ who ‘overreach others much wiser than themselves’, creating ‘at first a corruption… grown necessary’.<sup><a href="#ref31">31</a></sup> Taxes increased and ‘funds multiplied every year’ with the ‘landed interest’ footing the bill, so that ‘power that used to follow Land, is now gone over to Money’.<sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup></p>

    <p>Swift’s literary works also express anxiety about the ‘monied interest’. Duncan shows how <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1726) reflects Swift’s fear that a great part of the nation’s wealth fell into the hands of those unworthy of it, demonizing the ‘monied interest’ as driven by self-interest and incapable of preserving the social fabric.<sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup> In <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>, those like the ‘monied interest’ are portrayed as Yahoos who ‘could never have enough [money]… either to profusion or avarice’.<sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup></p>

    <p>Luna sheds light on Swift’s literary significance in providing a satirical form to abstract financial revolutions, pointing to allegories in <em>The Wonder of all the Wonders…</em> (1721) that satirize the illusory nature of stockjobbery.<sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup> Nicholson notes Swift ‘acted the part of a ‘moneyed’ man’ himself, investing in South Sea stock, thus ironically participating in what he condemned.<sup><a href="#ref36">36</a></sup></p>

    <p>At his most Harringtonian, in <em>The Advantages Proposed by Repealing the Sacramental Test</em> (1732), Swift praises the ‘landed interest’ as ‘those… whose private interest is united with the interest of their country… [they] wish the nation should thrive’.<sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup> The King of Lilliput in <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> similarly holds that he ‘whoever makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before’ does more service than all politicians combined.<sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bolingbroke, Walpole, and the ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Bolingbroke focused his objection to the ‘monied interest’ on Robert Walpole and his ‘Robinocracy’, a censorious term for Walpole’s ‘sinister network of influence’.<sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup> They shared intense animosity, fueling English political life between 1725 and 1740.<sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup> Bolingbroke censured the ‘Robinocracy’ for fostering corrupt interrelation with the ‘monied interest’ and for tax burdens benefitting the ‘monied interest’ at the expense of the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup></p>

    <p>Public borrowing was a pillar of ‘Robinocracy’. The ‘monied interest’ thrived through funding and stockjobbing. Bolingbroke in <em>The Craftsman</em> (1729) shows that honors, titles, and promises corrupted the ‘monied interest’ into propping up Walpole’s regime.<sup><a href="#ref42">42</a></sup> Bolingbroke saw the ‘Robinocrat’ ruling ‘by money, the Root of all Evils… founding iniquitous Dominion in the Corruption of the People’.<sup><a href="#ref43">43</a></sup></p>

    <p>He also resented the heavy taxation on the ‘landed interest’ to finance wars beneficial only to the ‘monied interest’, lamenting that a new type of property almost equal to the terra-firma of the island had arisen.<sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup> Thus, he adopts a neo-Harringtonian stance: ‘proprietors of the land… bore the immense load… while lenders contributed nothing’.<sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Davenant, the ‘Whig Junto’, and the ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Davenant, like Bolingbroke, censured the ‘monied interest’ indirectly by focusing on the ‘Whig Junto’.<sup><a href="#ref46">46</a></sup> In <em>An Essay Upon Ways and Means of supplying the War</em> (1695), he worried that long-continued high land taxes would drive landed men into the hands of usurers.<sup><a href="#ref47">47</a></sup> He questioned why London, ‘with all the wealth’, did not bear a greater share of taxes.<sup><a href="#ref48">48</a></sup> All taxes ultimately fell on land.<sup><a href="#ref49">49</a></sup></p>

    <p>In <em>Discourses on the Publick Revenues and on the Trade of England</em> (1698), Davenant objected to long-term borrowing that enriched ‘Mony’d men and usurers… drones of the common-wealth’.<sup><a href="#ref50">50</a></sup> He saw that ‘[t]hey who stand possessed of the ready money… have in all times, given the law, and held the rest in their power’.<sup><a href="#ref51">51</a></sup> The Romans had to rescue themselves from such oppression.<sup><a href="#ref52">52</a></sup> Davenant identified Marlborough’s role in rewarding Whig figures who then invested in government, taxing the ‘landed interest’ more.<sup><a href="#ref53">53</a></sup></p>

    <p>A peripheral question arises: Why did Burke, a Whig, use an anti-Whiggish notion like ‘monied interest’ to condemn the French revolutionaries? Hampshire-Monk explains that party distinctions were a ‘discredited category’, so Burke’s opposition to the ‘monied interest’ and support for the ‘landed interest’ is compatible with his Whiggery.<sup><a href="#ref54">54</a></sup> Swift also operated in these antithetical terms without party interests.<sup><a href="#ref55">55</a></sup></p>

    <p>Though no direct evidence shows Burke consciously adopting ‘monied interest’ from Queen Anne Tories, he knew Bolingbroke’s works. Burke’s famous grasshopper analogy echoes Swift’s notion of mistaking the echo of a London coffee-house for the voice of the kingdom.<sup><a href="#ref56">56</a></sup> Burke’s ‘monied interest’ strongly resonates with the Queen Anne Tories’ denunciation of the Whig ‘monied interest’.</p>

    <p>Burke applies ‘monied interest’ to French, not English society, differentiating himself. Yet, like the Tories, he casts it in opposition to the ‘landed interest’, seeing a ‘warfare between the noble ancient landed interest and the new monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref57">57</a></sup> Burke portrays the ‘monied interest’ as adventurous, disposed to new enterprises, wanting change, and as ‘confiscators’ akin to English monied lenders.<sup><a href="#ref58">58</a></sup></p>

    <p>Given its ubiquity, Burke likely subconsciously drew on these terms. A contemporary, French Laurence, wrote to Burke that Lord Fitzwilliam’s speech had made many converts at Batson’s among monied men, showing the discourse’s prevalence in England.<sup><a href="#ref59">59</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">II</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burke’s understanding of ancien régime France and ‘armed doctrine’</h2>

    <p>Pocock’s unequivocal citation of ‘monied interest’ from Queen Anne Tory vocabulary guides the French-English question for that doctrine, but not for ‘armed doctrine’.<sup><a href="#ref60">60</a></sup> The literature rarely cites ‘armed doctrine’, and where it does, no lineage is provided.<sup><a href="#ref61">61</a></sup></p>

    <p>O’Brien’s attempt to trace ‘armed doctrine’ in French discourse leads him to question its validity, arguing that Bonaparte’s doctrine coexisted with it.<sup><a href="#ref62">62</a></sup> But this presupposes Burke derived it from French discourse. If Burke aimed to minimize French linguistic effects in England, he wouldn’t rely on French discourse.<sup><a href="#ref63">63</a></sup></p>

    <p>Following Pocock’s second prong, ‘armed doctrine’ likely derived from Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.<sup><a href="#ref64">64</a></sup> Because ‘armed doctrine’ lacks English historical referents and no English event matches its definition – a system inimical to all governments, dominion over minds and bodies – Burke casts it as unlike the Glorious Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref65">65</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref66">66</a></sup> ‘Armed doctrine’ is analogous to religious conquests alien to English experience. Even 1688, for Burke, was a restoration, not a destruction. Cromwell’s Commonwealth is closest, but no direct evidence suggests this link. Thus, ‘armed doctrine’ lacks English ancestry.</p>

    <p>This chapter reconstructs Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France to show ‘armed doctrine’ derived from the combination of ‘men of letters’ and ‘monied interest’. We also show that ‘armed doctrine’ was well received by Burke’s English readers, suggesting he successfully disseminated a common understanding of pre-Revolution France.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burke’s understanding of ‘armed doctrine’ in ancien régime France</h2>

    <p>For Burke, ‘armed doctrine’ centers on ‘combination’, always pejorative and associated with ‘bad men’.<sup><a href="#ref67">67</a></sup> ‘When bad men combine, the good must associate.’ The ‘landed interest’, Burke claims, cannot combine due to the nature of country life and property.<sup><a href="#ref68">68</a></sup> Combination thus falls to the ‘monied interest’, who obtained power through public credit and resented the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref69">69</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref70">70</a></sup></p>

    <p>Another group, the ‘men of letters’, formed a literary cabal aiming to destroy the Christian religion.<sup><a href="#ref71">71</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref72">72</a></sup> They were atheistic fanatics who believed a state could subsist better without religion. Burke warned they wanted the power to persecute property, liberty, and life.<sup><a href="#ref73">73</a></sup> Visiting Paris in 1773, Burke noted the atheism in salons, showing their success.<sup><a href="#ref74">74</a></sup> The ‘men of letters’ cultivated the ‘monied interest’, recognizing its influence.<sup><a href="#ref75">75</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref76">76</a></sup> Thus, the ‘combination’ of ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ yielded ‘armed doctrine’ aimed at nobility and the church.</p>

    <p>Burke saw ‘armed doctrine’ emerge as the ‘monied interest’ subverted the state through confiscation of church property, striking at the nobility through the crown and church. If the ‘monied interest’ only wanted credit returned, why attack the clergy beyond their debt? Burke concludes the atheistic ‘men of letters’ and the spiteful ‘monied interest’ combined to produce an event unknown in nature.<sup><a href="#ref77">77</a></sup></p>

    <p>‘Armed doctrine’ for Burke resembled religious conquests (Genghis Khan, Mahomet) that overturned laws and manners, unlike any English precedent.<sup><a href="#ref78">78</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref79">79</a></sup> Thus, Burke portrayed the French Revolution’s atheism as unprecedented, unnatural conquest.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">The English reception of ‘armed doctrine’</h2>

    <p>The reception of ‘armed doctrine’ in England suggests Burke succeeded in implanting an understanding of pre-Revolution France. Gillray’s caricatures, like ‘Promis’d Horrors of the French Invasion’ (1796), show a Burkean instinct translating ‘armed doctrine’ into apocalyptic imagery with Fox leading French armies down St James’ Street, a guillotine at Brookes’s, and the ‘monied interest’ repossessing the Treasury.<sup><a href="#ref80">80</a></sup></p>

    <p>‘Armed doctrine’ was also referenced later by Henry Grattan, warning of the tyranny of the sword spreading through Europe and to Ulster.<sup><a href="#ref81">81</a></sup> William Pitt the Younger adopted Burke’s language, speaking of a war with ‘armed opinions’ and later the ‘liquid fire of Jacobin principles’, affirming Burke’s intention to shape English understanding.<sup><a href="#ref82">82</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref83">83</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">III</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Dreadful Energy</h2>

    <p>The existence of ‘’dreadful energy’, like ‘’armed doctrine’, is confined to Burke’s sole use of the term in his LRP.  Also like ‘armed doctrine’, ‘the historiographical literature on ‘dreadful energy’ fails to suggest that the term has ancestry in English discourse.   ‘Dreadful energy’, therefore, has  a scant existence in English discourse.</p>
    
    <p>The resemblance of ‘dreadful energy’ to the term ‘enthusiasm’, is, however, striking.  ‘Enthusiasm’.  The term ‘enthusiasm’ enjoyed prevalence in English discourse prior to and at the time of Burke’s writings and is a term also present in Burke’s work.  ‘Enthusiasm’, anachronistically, refers to a religious fervour of the individual captured by the divine or possessed with a religious spirit.  ‘Dreadful energy’ on the other hand refers to the circumstance ‘where nothing rules but the mind of desperate men’ and the ‘spectacle of human energy disengaged from any system of property relationships whatever’.   If ‘Enthusiasm’ is translated to into the terms of ‘dreadful energy’, then it is the spectacle of religious energy disengaged from any system of ecclesiastical relationship whatever and, therefore, ‘dreadful energy’ shares a secularised synonymy with ‘enthusiasm’.</p>

    <p>O’Neill suggests that Burke understood this resemblance of meaning, too.   O’Neill demonstrates that Burke established the resemblance ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’ himself in claiming that those ‘who have made but superficial studies in the Natural History of the human mind’ have understood ‘religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal, and sectarian propagation’.  This for Burke was a mistake because ‘there is no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the very same effect’ and man’s ‘social nature… impels him to propagate his principles’.   Thus, we see that ‘dreadful’ energy is an atheistic ‘enthusiasm’ or an ‘energy, restrained by no consideration of God or man’ (Burke, 1797). </p>

    <p>Pocock provides support in establishing the synonymy by inserting Burke into a hypothetical dialogue with Karl Marx.  In this ‘dialogue of the dead’, Karl Marx explains to Burke that ‘dreadful energy’ is merely the replacement of ‘one system of property relationship’ with another.   Pocock asserts that Burke would reply to Marx by deprecating him as another ‘learned and ingenious speculator’ that had failed ‘to recognize the spectacle of human energy disengaged from any system of property relationships whatever’.   Thus, ‘dreadful energy’, like ‘enthusiasm’, is ‘the spectacle of human energy disengaged’ from the world in which it is located. 
        Although Pocock answers the French-English question vis-à-vis ‘enthusiasm’ and shows that Burke ‘redefined’ ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to speak of the energy of French revolutionaries, he curiously fails to draw the link between ‘dreadful energy’ and ‘enthusiasm’.   Given that Pocock identified ‘dreadful energy’ seven years’ prior as pivotal to the French-English question, it is unclear why he failed to explicitly demonstrate the link between ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’ when it held an answer to what he called one of the most challenging questions around Burke’s work. </p>

<p>This chapter, therefore, rectifies the failure of Pocock to link the synonymy of ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘dreadful energy’, showing that ‘dreadful energy’ – via ‘enthusiasm’ – possessed a lineage in English discourse.  To this end, we first reconstruct Pocock’s argument that Burke ‘redefined’ ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to then apply it to descriptions of French revolutionaries.  We then show, with reference to Carroll’s ‘revisitation’ of Burke’s ‘enthusiasm’, that, instead of adopting ‘enthusiasm’, Burke coined ‘dreadful energy’.   He coined ‘dreadful energy’ to describe the events in France as atheistic and sui generis in history and so it required a new term to delineate it as something never before seen in English history.  We then show that the lack of response ‘dreadful energy’ receives from Burke’s readers either suggests that it was either understood as a superfluous term for ‘enthusiasm’ or that Burke failed to convey the term’s meaning. </p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify">Burke’s ‘redefinition’ of ‘enthusiasm’</h4>

<p>We first turn to Pocock’s argument that Burke transposed the English idea of ‘enthusiasm’ onto what he saw as the intellectual energies driving the French Revolution.  Pocock makes this claim in his Chapter on ‘Edmund Burke and the Redefinition of Enthusiasm: the Context as Counter-Revolution’.   The reconstruction of Pocock’s ‘redefinition’ requires, first, evidence that ‘enthusiasm’ existed in English discourse and, second, evidence that Burke saw a similar phenomenon in France. 
    </p>
    <p>The term ‘enthusiasm’ enjoyed relative ubiquity in seventeenth and eighteenth century English discourse following the Glorious Revolution and the Interregnum where it was used to denounce religious fanatics captured by a religious spirit.  Goldstein (1997) establishes that the prevalence of ‘enthusiasm’ in English discourse at this time is incontestable, citing several prominent publications and statements on the phenomenon.   The first publication on ‘enthusiasm’ was by the English philosopher Henry More (1614-1687), who writes ‘A Brief Discourse of The Nature, Causes, Kinds, and Cure of Enthusiasm’.   More was concerned about the prominence of ‘enthusiasm’, such that he warns that if ‘ever Christianity be exterminated, it will be by Enthusiasm’ (1660, p. vii).   More also proved influential to Burke, who Carroll cites as influencing Burke through his ‘Enthusiamus Triumphatus’ (1656), which provides the source of Burke’s own suspicions around ‘enthusiasm’.  The philosopher and physician John Locke (1632-1704) also developed an influential critique of ‘enthusiasm’ warning against the individual ‘so dim… as to take monsters lodged in his own brain for the images of the Deity’ (2000, p. 56).    The esteemed eighteenth century writer Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) also indicates the commonness of ‘enthusiasm’ via his definition of ‘enthusiasm’ in his Dictionary of the English language, defining the term as the ‘vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication’ (1755).  The Third Earl of Shaftesbury (1671-1713) also provides a stark condemnation of ‘enthusiasm’ in in his Letter Concerning Enthusiasm, where, along Burkean lines, he writes how ‘divine inspiration is a real feeling of the divine presence, and atheistic enthusiasm is a false one’ (2000).   Even Burke’s adversary, the chemist and philosopher, Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), wrote of the vanity and self-involvement of ‘enthusiasm’ as making one ‘imagine that we are the peculiar favourites of the divinity’ (1772, p. 121). </p>
    <p>It was under England’s own revolution of 1688 that ‘enthusiasm’ burgeoned, further supporting the claim that ‘dreadful energy’ was a derivation of ‘enthusiasm’.  ‘Enthusiasm’ was the preserve of esoteric religious sects and groups who arose during the Interregnum where, under dissolved government, conditions for social and religious dissent were appropriate (Pocock, 1989, p. 25).   It was the nearest thing that the English had to a ‘revolutionary consciousness’ (ibid., p. 26).   In England, however, ‘enthusiasm’ never gained revolutionary traction because it was located in a discourse of toleration.  ‘Enthusiasm’ was tolerated, but not encouraged like ‘dreadful energy’.  	Protestant dissenters received further toleration during the Glorious Revolution, which enabled ‘enthusiasm’ to burgeon.  Prior to 1688, James II made a bid for the support of nonconformists in England to shore up support for Catholicism.  This move alongside the birth of his Catholic heir and his libel of seven Protestant Bishops precipitated his deposition and the installation of William of Orange, securing the Protestant religion in England (Harris, 2006, pp. 241-242).   The removal of James II undermined the toleration offered by James II to Protestant Dissenters and Nonconformists, however.  The Anglican Church-state, therefore, made a bid to secure the support of Dissenters and Nonconformists via further acts of religious toleration (Pocock, 1989, p. 24).  The Toleration Act of 1689 was introduced, therefore, to enshrine the freedom of worship in law for Nonconformists, excepting Roman Catholics, but still excluding them from offices of the Crown and posts at universities (ibid.).   Dissenters also began to claim that 1688 re-affirmed their civil liberties through an act of the will of the people and, thus, all people, regardless of religion, possessed civil liberties.  Religion in England, therefore, was coming to be identified with freedom of religion or the freedom to search for religious beliefs – ‘enthusiasm’.  Thus, ‘enthusiasm’ was a term present in English discourse and one which resulted from competing bids during the Glorious Revolution for further religious tolerance providing fertile ground for ‘enthusiasm’.  </p>
    <p>There is also evidence that Burke was aware of the term ‘enthusiasm’.  He used ‘enthusiasm’ to chastise his critics.  For example he censured the chemist and philosopher Joseph Priestley for seeing everything ‘in their constitution and government at home… as illegitimate and usurped, or at best as a vain mockery’, (Reflections, p. 217).   Priestley’s disdain for everything at home, Burke claims, led him to look ‘abroad with an eager and passionate enthusiasm’.  Burke also used the term to ridicule the ‘famous sermon of the Old Jewry’ (ibid., p. 224) given by his adversary Richard Price whose ‘enthusiasm kindles as he advances; and when he arrives at his peroration it is in a full blaze’.   </p>
    <p>We turn, next, to establish Burke’s identification of ‘enthusiasm’ in France.  There existed a curious semantic overlap between the openness of belief that was seen under English Unitarian theology and the ‘electrick communication’ (LRP, p. 186) – ‘transparence’  (Pocock, 1989, p. 33) – of the ‘men of letters’ that Burke saw in France.   Pocock makes clear that it was ‘in Unitarian theology… [that] we find the nearest approach to a Rousseauist transparence to be discoverable in the English discourse of the years before the French Revolution’ (Pocock, 1989, p. 25).   Locke, who was alleged to be a rational and Unitarian dissenter, was accused of ‘transparence’.  The Welsh economist and political writer Josiah Tucker (1713-1799) labelled Locke as an ‘honest, undissembling Rousseau’ (1781, p. 39).   Locke was a spearhead of arguments for increased religious toleration following 1688, which he saw to affirm the religious rights of all.  Although ‘enthusiasm’ in England was limited by its location in a discourse of toleration, under ‘transparence’ in France there was no ‘means of arresting a principle in its course’ (LRP, II, p. 186) and, thus, ‘dreadful energy’ flourished.   Burke, therefore, identifies an inclination towards transparency in both England and France, which enables the ‘enthusiasm’ that he sees in England and ‘dreadful energy’ in France.  </p>
    <p>Pocock’s characterisation of Burke’s drawing on English discourse – particularly vis-à-vis 1688 – to inform English understandings of the French revolution, further supports the claim that Burke drew on ‘enthusiasm’ to inform the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw in France.  English discourse was averse towards the ‘sovereignty of self-creating discourse’ (ibid., p. 20) seen in France.   This is indicated by the basis from which Burke’s discussion of the French Revolution came about: was the French Revolution seen as the same kind as 1688 and could English discourse capture it?  Burke’s Reflections was written in response to Richard Price’s sermon ‘On the Love of Our Country’, which was given by Price 101 years after 1688.  Both Reflections and Price’s sermon, therefore, were a ‘renewed discussion of the English Revolution a century before’ (Pocock, 1989, p. 21).   What is also clear is that the French Revolution was capable of creating ‘renewals and even innovations’ (ibid., p. 21) in English discourse, but it was incapable of recreating English discourse entirely or placing within it a revolutionary discourse.   </p>
    <p>‘Enthusiasm’ was encoded into English discourse with negative connotations to the extent that a rejection of ‘enthusiasm’ was seen as a necessary part of the defence of the Whig order (ibid., p. 26).   Such was this the case that David Hume (1711-1776) and Adam Smith (1723-1790) offered critiques of ‘enthusiasm’, which defended this Whig order.  Further reinforcing the idea that ‘transparence’ or ‘enthusiasm’ were encoded by English discourse is Burke’s own statement of ‘dreadful energy’ where he casts the ‘dreadful energy’ of the French Jacobins in terms of an English character.  Burke draws on James Harrington, the ‘learned and ingenious speculator’ (LRP, p. 183).   He casts Harrington as an English Jacobin – or the closest thing to it – and makes clear that what happened in France is even something that Harrington ‘who has tossed about society into all forms, never could imagine to be possible’ (ibid.).   Thus, even Burke’s representation of the French Jacobin is encoded by English discourse and in this case an example of an English radical.  Burke did not want the Revolution explained out of a concern for its normalisation and to speak of the French Jacobins in their own terms would have been to do just that (Blakemore, 1984).   </p>
    <p>It remains unclear, however, why Burke did not label the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw in France as that of the ‘enthusiasm’ he saw in England.  We suggest – via Carroll  (2014) – that the ‘dreadful energy’ Burke witnessed was sui generis in history and, thus, Burke wanted to retain the meaning of ‘enthusiasm’ but de-couple the term from English discourse so as to prevent its spread in England.   Carroll disputes Pocock’s interpretation that Burke saw the ‘enthusiasm’ in France as merely redolent of that present in seventeenth and eighteenth centuryseventeenth- and eighteenth-century England.  Carroll argues that Burke regarded ‘enthusiasm’ as a ‘revolution of moral psychology’ (Carroll, 2014, p. 344), where the Jacobin no longer regards their actions of ‘enthusiasm’ with shame.   This was of acute concern to Burke because ‘enthusiasm’ in England was understood to dissipate after time (ibid., p. 321), but Burke feared that the fervour of the ideological zealot did not, thus, constituting a new ‘dreadful energy’.   
    <p>The emotional temper of Burke’s response also suggests that he saw the ‘dreadful energy’ in France as different from mere religious ‘enthusiasm’.  In the course of Burke’s denunciation of the events he saw in France and of the ‘dreadful energy’ he saw, he was himself accused of ‘enthusiasm’.  The English philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) accused Burke of lacking a reasoned opposition to the doctrine of the rights of man, which had gained intellectual currency in France.  Rather she accused Burke of rejecting the rights of man from a position of mere ‘romantic enthusiasm’ (1995, p. 46).   Such was the prevalence of concern for Burke’s ‘enthusiasm’ against the French Revolution that his parliamentary colleagues warned that if he failed to control himself, they would have him committed as a madman (Kramnick, 1977, p. 181).   Burke rejected such accusations and claimed that he was ‘no enthusiast’ (Corr., IX, p. 238), but rather ‘a sober and reflecting man’ (ibid.).  </p>    
    </p>

    <p>Turning, finally, to the reception of ‘dreadful energy.  ‘Dreadful energy’ received relatively little reception from Burke’s contemporaries.  This suggests that either Burke’s failed to disseminate the doctrine or that it proved superfluous in light of its resemblance to ‘enthusiasm’.  The traceable reception that it did receive was not from a fellow traveller of anti-Jacobinism, however.  John Thelwall (1764-1834) a political orator and writer, who had previously written a ‘Sober Reflections on the Seditious and Inflammatory Letter of the Rt. Hon. Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord’, left traces of the doctrine in his book ‘The Rights of Nature against the Usurpations of Establishments’.  Almost adopting ‘dreadful energy’ and attempting to couch it in positive terms, against ‘ancient habits’ (1796, p. 75), Thelwall writes that the ‘new opinion prevailed, because there is an incalculable distance between the energy and enthusiasm of a new conviction, and the science and mechanism of ancient habits’ (1796, p. 75). </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">IV</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The three doctrines cited by Pocock from Burke’s Reflections and LRP have complex origins, with ancestries more-so in English discourse than in Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.   Whilst further exploration of the French-English question and, indeed, Burke’s three doctrines would benefit this area of Burkean studies, this work answers the question posed by Pocock 41 years ago regarding the extent to which his work represents a commentary on English affairs or that of a commentary on French affairs (1982a, p. 348).  </a></sup></p>

    <p>An affirmation is also provided to Pocock’s previous works, which hint answers to the French-English question (see 1982a; 1989).  First, Chapter Section One  shows that ‘monied interest’ possesses a lineage from the works of Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant, affirming Pocock’s assertion that the doctrine was indeed part of the language of Queen Anne Tories.  ‘drawn straight from the vocabulary of Queen Anne Toryism’ (Pocock, 1982a, p. 338).  Chapter Three draws a crucial link between ‘dreadful energy’, ‘enthusiasm and, thus, shows the English origins of ‘dreadful energy’ because Burke transposed ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to his descriptions of France.  Chapter Two represents an anomaly vis-à-vis Chapter One and Three because ‘armed doctrine’ is a derivation of Burke understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ in pre-Revolution France.  We also show, however, that Burke described his understanding of pre-Revolution France in English terms, such as ‘monied interest’.  ‘Armed doctrine’ also represents a curious discursive anomaly with a significant positive reception in English discourse following Burke’s employment of the doctrine.  This either represents Burke’s accomplished propagation of the doctrine or a pre-existing understanding of its meaning, and thus pre-Revolution France, amongst his English readers.</p>

    <p>A significant contribution is also made by this work to Harris’ claim (2022) that Burke wrote in a language that was intended to appeal to the representatives of the English nation and when they warmly affirmed his account of the English nation his work was ‘authenticated’.   Chapter One shows that Burke drew on ‘monied interest’, which was already present in English discourse, to appeal to the critics of ‘monied interest’ at home in denouncing a section of pre-Revolution French society.  Chapter Two also contributes to Harris’ thesis, despite ‘armed doctrine’s’ ostensible non-English origins.  ‘Armed doctrine’ received the largest tracible reception with a clear affirmation from the leader of the nation at that time – Pitt the Younger.  Chapter Three shows that, whilst ‘dreadful energy’ failed to receive much attention from Burke’s readers, the doctrine was likely a guise for ‘enthusiasm’ which had prominence of English discourse prior to and following Burke.  Further research on the reception of ‘enthusiasm’ would, therefore, benefit this area. </p>

    <p>Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ also elicit the notion that Burke possessed the intention of warning his English readers away from the revolutionary events in France.  This corresponds with Blakemore’s claim  (1984) that Burke saw the French Revolution as a linguistic event that risked emptying English discourse and filling it instead with words and phrases of revolution.   Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ show his diligence in preserving terms which had historical significance in English discourse and which Burke may have feared would be destroyed by the ‘sovereignty of self-creating discourse’ (Pocock, 1989, p. 20) that existed in France.   </p>

   <p>Burke’s reputation as an opponent of the French Revolution is distinctly reaffirmed and shown as an underpinning intention of his Reflections and LRP.  He uses the doctrines of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ to illustrate that dangers previously existing in England after 1688, were alive in France in all new kinds.  Even his understanding of pre-Revolution France is constructed in English terms.  For instance, ‘armed doctrine’ is a ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ – which Queen Anne Tories knew in England – and others.  The depth of discursive encoding from 1688 at play in Burke’s work is, therefore, touched upon by his three doctrines.  The intention of Burke’s writing of Reflections and his LRP is paramount to the French-English question and we have shown that his three doctrines are a set of cunning linguistic moves focused at keeping away the ‘Colossus which bestrides our channel’ (LRP, p. 76).  </p>
