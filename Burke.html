    <h2 style="text-align: center;">BURKE’S THREE DOCTRINES AND THE FRENCH ENGLISH QUESTION OF REFLECTIONS</h2>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An important and surprisingly untouched question in Burkean studies is whether and indeed how Burke used his anti-revolutionary writings on the French Revolution as a cat-call warning for England. An important question in Burkean studies that remains unanswered is how Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em> represent a commentary on French affairs and how far they represent an implicit commentary on English affairs. John Pocock proposes that this question can be answered through an understanding of two things: the derivation of three doctrines of Burke from English discourse or from his understanding of pre-Revolution France. ‘Monied interest’<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> was a term originating from the Tory denunciation of Whigs during the rule of Queen Anne and thus can be understood in thoroughly English terms. Next, ‘armed doctrine’<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> originated from Burke’s understanding of the last phase of ancien régime France, but it was well received by Burke’s sympathetic English readers. Finally, ‘dreadful energy’<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> was drawn from David Hume’s conceptions of enthusiasm.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Burke, Pocock, French Revolution, monied interest, armed doctrine, dreadful energy.</p>

    <p>Significant scholarly work has now been undertaken to consider the historiography of Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections</em>, other writings, and speeches.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> Despite historiographical advances in understanding Burke’s work, significant questions around the nature of his thought remain unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup> In fact, John Pocock goes as far as to claim that ‘one of the most difficult questions in Burkean studies’ remains unanswered.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> This gap in the literature concerns how far Burke’s ‘writings on the French Revolution form a commentary on English [affairs] and how far on French affairs’.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> More specifically, how far were Burke’s anti-revolutionary writings grounded in a language existing in English discourse and how far a language derived from his understanding of France prior to the Revolution. This is what we term – for the purpose of brevity – the French-English question. It is a question implicitly established by Burke in the full title of his <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris</em>.<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Given that the French-English question remains one of the most challenging historiographical questions of Burke’s work, it is curious that little scholarly work has addressed it. Only Beales contributes to the question through his conclusion that Burke’s recondite writings on the French monasteries in <em>Reflections</em> constitute a definite ‘commentary on the situation in France’ and thus part of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>Pocock proposes a two-pronged framework to address the French-English question.<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup> The first prong consists of the investigation of the origins and reception of Burke’s three doctrines among his English readers. This demonstrates how far Burke was writing in a discourse common to his English readers and what the sources of that discourse were. Burke’s three doctrines, identified by Pocock and around which this article revolves, are ‘monied interest’, ‘armed doctrine’, and ‘dreadful energy’. The second prong calls for a study of Burke’s understanding of the last phase(s) of the ancien régime society of France. Naturally, a set of <em>Reflections</em> on the French Revolution could not be constituted entirely by English tropes, concepts, and preconceptions, and thus must include information about France and what led to the Revolution. This article, therefore, represents a first attempt at the French-English question. We show that two of the three doctrines are a product of English discourse and that the other – ‘armed doctrine’ – was a product of Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France, though it has traces of English discourse within it.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, a consequence of our claim is that Burke did indeed write about France in English terms, praising England and denouncing France in English terms in a manner that appealed to the representatives of England.<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup> This significantly contributes to Harris’ claim that Burke intended to write an account of the English nation that he knew would align with a common understanding among its representatives in the Church, Monarchy, Universities, and other national institutions.<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> This ‘authenticated’ his account of England as experientially real by those who represented it, but also shows that his fears of France – expressed in English terms – were shared by those who ‘authenticated him’.</p>

    <p>It is, however, Skinner’s intentional contextualism that holds the key to establishing our claim that Burke wrote about events in France in terms which originated from English discourse events to sway his readers away from acts of imitation.<sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup> The implicit discursive contextuality of the French-English question – where it can only be understood in terms of Burke’s position vis-à-vis England, France, and revolution – renders it incompatible with the perennial approach of historiography which seeks timeless answers to political questions from political texts. Whilst Burke’s opposition to revolution arose from his rejection of abstract reason,<sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup> such an explanation of Burke obfuscates the context of his opposition to the events in France. The contextualist methodology should also be avoided because it regards political thought as a mere composite of the religious, social, political, and economic contexts in which a writer is ensconced. Again, the French-English question is incompatible with contextualism because it is unclear how Burke could have been ardently anti-revolution when plenty of Englishmen were sympathetic to the Jacobin cause. Skinner’s intentional contextualism – where all statements are ‘the embodiment of a particular intention, on a particular occasion, addressed to the solution of a particular problem’<sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup> – unlocks our thesis that Burke intended his three doctrines as a warning call to his English readers against the replication of French events in England. It is, therefore, only under Skinner’s methodology that the French-English question, and our claim, is rendered comprehensible.</p>

    <p>Finally, our argument considers each of Burke’s doctrines in sequence. In Chapter One, we show that ‘monied interest’ originates from the censure of Whig Rule by Queen Anne Tories. Chapter Two shows that ‘armed doctrine’ was a derivation of Burke’s understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘Men of Letters’, ‘philosophes’, and ‘monied interest’ in pre-Revolution France. Chapter Three shows that ‘dreadful energy’ had origins in the religious term of censure ‘enthusiasm’, which also had origins in English discourse prior to the Revolution.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">I</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">The origins of monied interest in Queen Anne Toryism</h2>

    <p>Burke uses ‘landed’ and ‘monied’ interest as terms which illuminate pre-Revolution French society. Both terms, however, have English lineage.<sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup> These antithetical terms were used by ‘Queen Anne Tories’ who ‘thunder[ed] against Whig Rule as that of a monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup> It is ‘Queen Anne Tories’ such as Jonathan Swift, Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, and Charles Davenant from whom Burke’s ‘language is drawn straight’.<sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup> Although the ‘monied interest’ in England under Queen Anne aroused ‘fears that were shared by most of the landed gentry of the age’, our focus on Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant results from the prominence of their writings on ‘monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup></p>

    <p>In the discourse of Queen Anne, ‘monied interest’ denoted those who ‘invested capital in systems of public credit’ to provide stability following the Glorious Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ of England then, was ‘not trade but finance, not merchants but stockjobbers’ or more specifically ‘the structure of public credit… which had been operating through the Bank of England and the national debt’.<sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ are cast in oppositional terms to the traditional, and politically hegemonic, ‘landed interest’ who feared a transference of power under Whig rule.<sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup> This was perhaps justified given the nascent hegemony of the ‘monied’ institutions of the Bank of England, the East India Company, and the City Banks.<sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup></p>

    <p>The ‘monied interest’ sought political means of exerting influence, too. They found more ‘obscure ways’ of exerting their financial power, including lobbying the Royal Court, introducing personally advantageous parliamentary bills, and placing pressure on government through threats to remove Treasury funding.<sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup> The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to show how Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant drew on ideas of ‘monied interest’ to denounce Whig rule they saw as corrupt and dangerous, which in turn shows the ancestry of Burke’s ‘monied interest’ in English discourse, applied to French revolutionaries.</p>

    <p>Pocock alludes to an even earlier genesis of ‘monied interest’, despite affirming it originated from the ‘Queen Anne Tories’. Tory censures of ‘monied interest’ had Harringtonian undertones, forged in neo-Harringtonian terms. James Harrington argued that property bestowed independence, and thus power must be distributed without encroachment on property. The neo-Harringtonians held that the English constitution was a bulwark for propertied independence against arbitrary power, but only where a balance between Crown and Parliament existed.<sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup> The ‘monied interest’ subverts this balance by ingratiating itself with the Court and the administration. Harrington provided the basis for the claim that the utility of a ‘landed interest’ lay in their propertied independence. The neo-Harringtonians adopted this to denounce the Crown’s power of Parliamentary patronage (corruption).<sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Swiftian ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Swift, as a leading ‘Queen Anne Tory’ and literary figure, produced several political pamphlets and essays denouncing the ‘monied interest’. Cook claims the terms ‘landed interest’ and ‘monied interest’ were ‘two opposing sets of terms that turn through Swift’s political tracts like a leitmotif’.<sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup> Perhaps the most notable is <em>The Conduct of the Allies</em> (1711), where Swift censures the Whigs for protracting a war beneficial only to the ‘monied interest’ who ‘had raised vast sums by trading with stocks and funds, and lending upon great interest and premiums; whose perpetual harvest is war’.<sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup> Swift saw the ‘monied interest’ as ‘fond of war’ and entreaties them to ‘furnish out one campaign at their own charge’ because of the financial burden on the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup> In <em>The Examiner</em> (1710-1714), he rebukes the ‘great numbers [who] find their profit in prolonging the war’, ‘Men quite different from any ever known before the Revolution’.<sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup> Most damningly, Swift reproaches the ‘monied interest’ who ‘overreach others much wiser than themselves’, creating ‘at first a corruption… grown necessary’.<sup><a href="#ref31">31</a></sup> Taxes increased and ‘funds multiplied every year’ with the ‘landed interest’ footing the bill, so that ‘power that used to follow Land, is now gone over to Money’.<sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup></p>

    <p>Swift’s literary works also express anxiety about the ‘monied interest’. Duncan shows how <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1726) reflects Swift’s fear that a great part of the nation’s wealth fell into the hands of those unworthy of it, demonizing the ‘monied interest’ as driven by self-interest and incapable of preserving the social fabric.<sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup> In <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>, those like the ‘monied interest’ are portrayed as Yahoos who ‘could never have enough [money]… either to profusion or avarice’.<sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup></p>

    <p>Luna sheds light on Swift’s literary significance in providing a satirical form to abstract financial revolutions, pointing to allegories in <em>The Wonder of all the Wonders…</em> (1721) that satirize the illusory nature of stockjobbery.<sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup> Nicholson notes Swift ‘acted the part of a ‘moneyed’ man’ himself, investing in South Sea stock, thus ironically participating in what he condemned.<sup><a href="#ref36">36</a></sup></p>

    <p>At his most Harringtonian, in <em>The Advantages Proposed by Repealing the Sacramental Test</em> (1732), Swift praises the ‘landed interest’ as ‘those… whose private interest is united with the interest of their country… [they] wish the nation should thrive’.<sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup> The King of Lilliput in <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> similarly holds that he ‘whoever makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before’ does more service than all politicians combined.<sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bolingbroke, Walpole, and the ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Bolingbroke focused his objection to the ‘monied interest’ on Robert Walpole and his ‘Robinocracy’, a censorious term for Walpole’s ‘sinister network of influence’.<sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup> They shared intense animosity, fueling English political life between 1725 and 1740.<sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup> Bolingbroke censured the ‘Robinocracy’ for fostering corrupt interrelation with the ‘monied interest’ and for tax burdens benefitting the ‘monied interest’ at the expense of the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup></p>

    <p>Public borrowing was a pillar of ‘Robinocracy’. The ‘monied interest’ thrived through funding and stockjobbing. Bolingbroke in <em>The Craftsman</em> (1729) shows that honors, titles, and promises corrupted the ‘monied interest’ into propping up Walpole’s regime.<sup><a href="#ref42">42</a></sup> Bolingbroke saw the ‘Robinocrat’ ruling ‘by money, the Root of all Evils… founding iniquitous Dominion in the Corruption of the People’.<sup><a href="#ref43">43</a></sup></p>

    <p>He also resented the heavy taxation on the ‘landed interest’ to finance wars beneficial only to the ‘monied interest’, lamenting that a new type of property almost equal to the terra-firma of the island had arisen.<sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup> Thus, he adopts a neo-Harringtonian stance: ‘proprietors of the land… bore the immense load… while lenders contributed nothing’.<sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Davenant, the ‘Whig Junto’, and the ‘monied interest’</h2>

    <p>Davenant, like Bolingbroke, censured the ‘monied interest’ indirectly by focusing on the ‘Whig Junto’.<sup><a href="#ref46">46</a></sup> In <em>An Essay Upon Ways and Means of supplying the War</em> (1695), he worried that long-continued high land taxes would drive landed men into the hands of usurers.<sup><a href="#ref47">47</a></sup> He questioned why London, ‘with all the wealth’, did not bear a greater share of taxes.<sup><a href="#ref48">48</a></sup> All taxes ultimately fell on land.<sup><a href="#ref49">49</a></sup></p>

    <p>In <em>Discourses on the Publick Revenues and on the Trade of England</em> (1698), Davenant objected to long-term borrowing that enriched ‘Mony’d men and usurers… drones of the common-wealth’.<sup><a href="#ref50">50</a></sup> He saw that ‘[t]hey who stand possessed of the ready money… have in all times, given the law, and held the rest in their power’.<sup><a href="#ref51">51</a></sup> The Romans had to rescue themselves from such oppression.<sup><a href="#ref52">52</a></sup> Davenant identified Marlborough’s role in rewarding Whig figures who then invested in government, taxing the ‘landed interest’ more.<sup><a href="#ref53">53</a></sup></p>

    <p>A peripheral question arises: Why did Burke, a Whig, use an anti-Whiggish notion like ‘monied interest’ to condemn the French revolutionaries? Hampshire-Monk explains that party distinctions were a ‘discredited category’, so Burke’s opposition to the ‘monied interest’ and support for the ‘landed interest’ is compatible with his Whiggery.<sup><a href="#ref54">54</a></sup> Swift also operated in these antithetical terms without party interests.<sup><a href="#ref55">55</a></sup></p>

    <p>Though no direct evidence shows Burke consciously adopting ‘monied interest’ from Queen Anne Tories, he knew Bolingbroke’s works. Burke’s famous grasshopper analogy echoes Swift’s notion of mistaking the echo of a London coffee-house for the voice of the kingdom.<sup><a href="#ref56">56</a></sup> Burke’s ‘monied interest’ strongly resonates with the Queen Anne Tories’ denunciation of the Whig ‘monied interest’.</p>

    <p>Burke applies ‘monied interest’ to French, not English society, differentiating himself. Yet, like the Tories, he casts it in opposition to the ‘landed interest’, seeing a ‘warfare between the noble ancient landed interest and the new monied interest’.<sup><a href="#ref57">57</a></sup> Burke portrays the ‘monied interest’ as adventurous, disposed to new enterprises, wanting change, and as ‘confiscators’ akin to English monied lenders.<sup><a href="#ref58">58</a></sup></p>

    <p>Given its ubiquity, Burke likely subconsciously drew on these terms. A contemporary, French Laurence, wrote to Burke that Lord Fitzwilliam’s speech had made many converts at Batson’s among monied men, showing the discourse’s prevalence in England.<sup><a href="#ref59">59</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">II</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burke’s understanding of ancien régime France and ‘armed doctrine’</h2>

    <p>Pocock’s unequivocal citation of ‘monied interest’ from Queen Anne Tory vocabulary guides the French-English question for that doctrine, but not for ‘armed doctrine’.<sup><a href="#ref60">60</a></sup> The literature rarely cites ‘armed doctrine’, and where it does, no lineage is provided.<sup><a href="#ref61">61</a></sup></p>

    <p>O’Brien’s attempt to trace ‘armed doctrine’ in French discourse leads him to question its validity, arguing that Bonaparte’s doctrine coexisted with it.<sup><a href="#ref62">62</a></sup> But this presupposes Burke derived it from French discourse. If Burke aimed to minimize French linguistic effects in England, he wouldn’t rely on French discourse.<sup><a href="#ref63">63</a></sup></p>

    <p>Following Pocock’s second prong, ‘armed doctrine’ likely derived from Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.<sup><a href="#ref64">64</a></sup> Because ‘armed doctrine’ lacks English historical referents and no English event matches its definition – a system inimical to all governments, dominion over minds and bodies – Burke casts it as unlike the Glorious Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref65">65</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref66">66</a></sup> ‘Armed doctrine’ is analogous to religious conquests alien to English experience. Even 1688, for Burke, was a restoration, not a destruction. Cromwell’s Commonwealth is closest, but no direct evidence suggests this link. Thus, ‘armed doctrine’ lacks English ancestry.</p>

    <p>This chapter reconstructs Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France to show ‘armed doctrine’ derived from the combination of ‘men of letters’ and ‘monied interest’. We also show that ‘armed doctrine’ was well received by Burke’s English readers, suggesting he successfully disseminated a common understanding of pre-Revolution France.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burke’s understanding of ‘armed doctrine’ in ancien régime France</h2>

    <p>For Burke, ‘armed doctrine’ centers on ‘combination’, always pejorative and associated with ‘bad men’.<sup><a href="#ref67">67</a></sup> ‘When bad men combine, the good must associate.’ The ‘landed interest’, Burke claims, cannot combine due to the nature of country life and property.<sup><a href="#ref68">68</a></sup> Combination thus falls to the ‘monied interest’, who obtained power through public credit and resented the ‘landed interest’.<sup><a href="#ref69">69</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref70">70</a></sup></p>

    <p>Another group, the ‘men of letters’, formed a literary cabal aiming to destroy the Christian religion.<sup><a href="#ref71">71</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref72">72</a></sup> They were atheistic fanatics who believed a state could subsist better without religion. Burke warned they wanted the power to persecute property, liberty, and life.<sup><a href="#ref73">73</a></sup> Visiting Paris in 1773, Burke noted the atheism in salons, showing their success.<sup><a href="#ref74">74</a></sup> The ‘men of letters’ cultivated the ‘monied interest’, recognizing its influence.<sup><a href="#ref75">75</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref76">76</a></sup> Thus, the ‘combination’ of ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ yielded ‘armed doctrine’ aimed at nobility and the church.</p>

    <p>Burke saw ‘armed doctrine’ emerge as the ‘monied interest’ subverted the state through confiscation of church property, striking at the nobility through the crown and church. If the ‘monied interest’ only wanted credit returned, why attack the clergy beyond their debt? Burke concludes the atheistic ‘men of letters’ and the spiteful ‘monied interest’ combined to produce an event unknown in nature.<sup><a href="#ref77">77</a></sup></p>

    <p>‘Armed doctrine’ for Burke resembled religious conquests (Genghis Khan, Mahomet) that overturned laws and manners, unlike any English precedent.<sup><a href="#ref78">78</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref79">79</a></sup> Thus, Burke portrayed the French Revolution’s atheism as unprecedented, unnatural conquest.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">The English reception of ‘armed doctrine’</h2>

    <p>The reception of ‘armed doctrine’ in England suggests Burke succeeded in implanting an understanding of pre-Revolution France. Gillray’s caricatures, like ‘Promis’d Horrors of the French Invasion’ (1796), show a Burkean instinct translating ‘armed doctrine’ into apocalyptic imagery with Fox leading French armies down St James’ Street, a guillotine at Brookes’s, and the ‘monied interest’ repossessing the Treasury.<sup><a href="#ref80">80</a></sup></p>

    <p>‘Armed doctrine’ was also referenced later by Henry Grattan, warning of the tyranny of the sword spreading through Europe and to Ulster.<sup><a href="#ref81">81</a></sup> William Pitt the Younger adopted Burke’s language, speaking of a war with ‘armed opinions’ and later the ‘liquid fire of Jacobin principles’, affirming Burke’s intention to shape English understanding.<sup><a href="#ref82">82</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref83">83</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">III</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dreadful Energy</h2>

    <p>‘Dreadful energy’, like ‘armed doctrine’, is cited only once by Burke in <em>LRP</em><sup><a href="#ref84">84</a></sup> and lacks known English lineage. But it closely resembles ‘enthusiasm’, a term prevalent in English discourse and in Burke’s writings. ‘Enthusiasm’ originally meant religious fervor, while ‘dreadful energy’ is a spectacle of human energy disengaged from any system of property or ecclesiastical relationships – a secularized ‘enthusiasm’.<sup><a href="#ref85">85</a></sup></p>

    <p>O’Neill shows Burke understood this resemblance. Burke argued that religious opinions are not the only cause of enthusiastic zeal; any doctrine could produce the same effect. Thus ‘dreadful energy’ is a form of atheistic ‘enthusiasm’.<sup><a href="#ref86">86</a></sup></p>

    <p>Pocock supports this by placing Burke in a hypothetical dialogue with Marx, where Burke would insist ‘dreadful energy’ is human energy disengaged from property relations, mirroring ‘enthusiasm’ removed from its religious context.<sup><a href="#ref87">87</a></sup> Yet Pocock, who identified ‘dreadful energy’ before, did not explicitly link it to ‘enthusiasm’.<sup><a href="#ref88">88</a></sup></p>

    <p>This chapter rectifies that omission: ‘dreadful energy’ originated from the English concept of ‘enthusiasm’ by Burke’s redefinition. Carroll argues that Burke saw French ‘enthusiasm’ as a revolution in moral psychology, unlike the shame-bound English ‘enthusiasm’, requiring a new term: ‘dreadful energy’.<sup><a href="#ref89">89</a></sup></p>

    <p>Wollstonecraft accused Burke of ‘romantic enthusiasm’ in opposing the Rights of Man,<sup><a href="#ref90">90</a></sup> and colleagues threatened to commit him as a madman if he did not calm down.<sup><a href="#ref91">91</a></sup> Burke claimed he was ‘no enthusiast’ but a sober man. ‘Dreadful energy’ received little response, perhaps seen as superfluous or misunderstood. Only John Thelwall tried to reframe it positively against ancient habits.<sup><a href="#ref92">92</a></sup></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">IV</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The three doctrines cited by Pocock from Burke’s Reflections and LRP have complex origins, with ancestries more-so in English discourse than in Burke’s understanding of pre-Revolution France.   Whilst further exploration of the French-English question and, indeed, Burke’s three doctrines would benefit this area of Burkean studies, this work answers the question posed by Pocock 41 years ago regarding the extent to which his work represents a commentary on English affairs or that of a commentary on French affairs (1982a, p. 348).  </a></sup></p>

    <p>An affirmation is also provided to Pocock’s previous works, which hint answers to the French-English question (see 1982a; 1989).  First, Chapter Section One  shows that ‘monied interest’ possesses a lineage from the works of Swift, Bolingbroke, and Davenant, affirming Pocock’s assertion that the doctrine was indeed part of the language of Queen Anne Tories.  ‘drawn straight from the vocabulary of Queen Anne Toryism’ (Pocock, 1982a, p. 338).  Chapter Three draws a crucial link between ‘dreadful energy’, ‘enthusiasm and, thus, shows the English origins of ‘dreadful energy’ because Burke transposed ‘enthusiasm’ from English discourse to his descriptions of France.  Chapter Two represents an anomaly vis-à-vis Chapter One and Three because ‘armed doctrine’ is a derivation of Burke understanding of the ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ and ‘men of letters’ in pre-Revolution France.  We also show, however, that Burke described his understanding of pre-Revolution France in English terms, such as ‘monied interest’.  ‘Armed doctrine’ also represents a curious discursive anomaly with a significant positive reception in English discourse following Burke’s employment of the doctrine.  This either represents Burke’s accomplished propagation of the doctrine or a pre-existing understanding of its meaning, and thus pre-Revolution France, amongst his English readers.</p>

    <p>A significant contribution is also made by this work to Harris’ claim (2022) that Burke wrote in a language that was intended to appeal to the representatives of the English nation and when they warmly affirmed his account of the English nation his work was ‘authenticated’.   Chapter One shows that Burke drew on ‘monied interest’, which was already present in English discourse, to appeal to the critics of ‘monied interest’ at home in denouncing a section of pre-Revolution French society.  Chapter Two also contributes to Harris’ thesis, despite ‘armed doctrine’s’ ostensible non-English origins.  ‘Armed doctrine’ received the largest tracible reception with a clear affirmation from the leader of the nation at that time – Pitt the Younger.  Chapter Three shows that, whilst ‘dreadful energy’ failed to receive much attention from Burke’s readers, the doctrine was likely a guise for ‘enthusiasm’ which had prominence of English discourse prior to and following Burke.  Further research on the reception of ‘enthusiasm’ would, therefore, benefit this area. </p>

    <p>Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ also elicit the notion that Burke possessed the intention of warning his English readers away from the revolutionary events in France.  This corresponds with Blakemore’s claim  (1984) that Burke saw the French Revolution as a linguistic event that risked emptying English discourse and filling it instead with words and phrases of revolution.   Burke’s use of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ show his diligence in preserving terms which had historical significance in English discourse and which Burke may have feared would be destroyed by the ‘sovereignty of self-creating discourse’ (Pocock, 1989, p. 20) that existed in France.   </p>

   <p>Burke’s reputation as an opponent of the French Revolution is distinctly reaffirmed and shown as an underpinning intention of his Reflections and LRP.  He uses the doctrines of ‘monied interest’ and ‘dreadful energy’ to illustrate that dangers previously existing in England after 1688, were alive in France in all new kinds.  Even his understanding of pre-Revolution France is constructed in English terms.  For instance, ‘armed doctrine’ is a ‘combination’ of the ‘monied interest’ – which Queen Anne Tories knew in England – and others.  The depth of discursive encoding from 1688 at play in Burke’s work is, therefore, touched upon by his three doctrines.  The intention of Burke’s writing of Reflections and his LRP is paramount to the French-English question and we have shown that his three doctrines are a set of cunning linguistic moves focused at keeping away the ‘Colossus which bestrides our channel’ (LRP, p. 76).  </p>
