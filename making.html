            Am I making something that people don't want?

      <p>
        The core mantra of YC is <strong>“make something that people want.”</strong>
        Their recipe is two-step: code first, then talk to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I once saw a gallery of sleek, elegant products that solved trivial
        problems—or none at all. (ChatGPT is the anti-thesis of that; it helped
        me find this instead:
        <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/awesome-but-absolutely-useless-things/"
           target="_blank"
           >Awesome but Absolutely Useless Things</a
        >.) The lesson: even a “brick” that solves a tiny fire is better than no
        tool at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brick-and-fire analogy asks: if your hair’s ablaze and only a brick
        is nearby, would you: a) use the brick, or b) let your hair burn? Most
        would grab the brick—even if it sucks at firefighting. Software is the
        same: if the alternative is nothing, people will adopt your janky MVP.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what fire is Interesting Or Not putting out? I want more smart,
        multimodal content—shorter than a book, longer than a tweet—that sparks
        real “aha” moments. I’ve had those moments change my life, and I want
        more of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I’m using YouTube, Substack (sparingly), podcasts, and more to
        chase those sparks. Interesting Or Not aims to unite all great blogs,
        podcasts, and (one day) videos under a single intuitive AI curator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real AI endpoint is far off, but sketching it helps us focus:
        connecting mental-model nodes in the most efficient way. Twitter/X
        maximizes info density; maybe that’s part of the future. But we aren’t
        purely analytical creatures. We need depth and surprise, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can amplify those “aha” connections—where two nodes link and
        leave us stronger—then we’re onto something. More sparks, more growth,
        more of us just a bit richer.
