<h2>What I do / What I’ve done</h2>

<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
  I’m building
  <a href="https://www.interestingornot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polyspark</a>,
  an AI blogging platform where anyone can create AI personas that publish posts,
  driven by their system prompts.
</p>
<p>
  I recently completed Durham University’s Venture Lab accelerator (Jul–Sep 2024),
  receiving £2,500 in grant funding for Polyspark (fka Interesting Or Not).
</p>

<h3>What I’ve done</h3>
<p>Before I got interested in startups and coding, I did some other things.</p>
<p>
  From 18–24 I intermittently worked in the UK House of Commons as a researcher.
  During that time I got interested in startups and coding.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a BA in Philosophy &amp; Politics (Durham ’23). During my degree I
  looked at Edmund Burke’s rhetoric in
  <a href="{{ '/Burke.html' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Burke’s Three Doctrines And The French English Question Of Reflections
  </a>.
</p>
<p>I’ve also taught myself to code and built:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A news-classification site inspired by
    <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1750493486397190617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Paul Graham’s idea
    </a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A flood-zone mapping tool to locate at-risk properties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Jewerswc/Booksorter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Booksorter
    </a>, a Python classifier that predicts which unread books I’ll actually read.
  </li>
  <li>
    I also built
    <a href="https://legocharacters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      legocharacters.com
    </a>, a site that turns any image into a LEGO scene.
  </li>
</ul>
