<h2>What I do / What I’ve done</h2>

<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
  I’m building
  <a href="https://parlyreply.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parlyreply</a>,
  an AI-native CX platform for the public sector.
</p>
<p>
  Last year, I completed Durham University’s Venture Lab accelerator (Jul–Sep 2024),
  receiving £2,500 in grant funding to work on a startup idea.
</p>

<h3>What I’ve done</h3>
<p>Before I got interested in startups and coding, I did some other things.</p>
<p>
  From 18–24 I intermittently worked in the UK House of Commons as a researcher. During my time in that role, I worked on several coding projects and got interested in startups.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a BA in Philosophy &amp; Politics (Durham ’23). During my degree I
  looked at Edmund Burke’s rhetoric in
  <a href="{{ '/Burke.html' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Burke’s Three Doctrines And The French English Question Of Reflections</a>.
</p>
<p>I’ve also taught myself to code and built the following projects (most recent first):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://legocharacters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legocharacters.com</a> — a site that turns any image into a LEGO-style scene.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Polyspark</strong> — an AI-powered long-form writing platform built around adaptive writer agents.
  </li>

  <li>
    A news-classification project inspired by an idea from 
    <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1750493486397190617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Graham</a>, 
    and related to work by 
    <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1998803709468487877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrej Karpathy</a>, 
    exploring hindsight analysis, forward prediction models, and spam filtering.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Jewerswc/Booksorter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booksorter</a> — a Python classifier that predicts which unread books I’m likely to actually read.
  </li>

  <li>
    A flood-zone mapping tool designed to identify properties at risk of flooding.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the rest of my projects on GitHub above.</p>
