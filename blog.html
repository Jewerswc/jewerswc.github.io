          <h2>Am I making something that people don't want (or at least not yet)</h2>
          <p>The core mantra of YC is ‘make something that people want’. Their recipe for that is two-fold. i) Write code and ii) talk to users. Beyond that, you have to make sure that you solving a real problem that people have. There is a great photo that I saw maybe a year back of products that are sleek, almost I suppose well designed, but its a push to be able to tell what they do and what problem they solve. (As a side note, ChatGPT is the anti-thesis of this. It helped me find, not the exact picture, but this instead: https://www.boredpanda.com/awesome-but-absolutely-useless-things/). The idea is that if you can solve a problem, even albeit for a small number of people, and create 'a small but intense fire' then you might be well on the way.</p>
          <p>The brick and fire analogy is often used to stretch out the meaning of this. If your hair was on fire and only a brick was around, would you a) use the brick to put the fire out, or b) let your hair burn. Most, its probably safe to assume, would use the brick, despite it being bad at putting out fires. The same goes for software. If the alternative is nothing or so incredibly bad, then you’ll use the software equivalent of a brick to solve a problem. So even if what you build is janky, has problems, but its the only thing available, people will use it.</p>
       <p>The question that I come back to with Interesting Or Not, then is what fire is this brick putting out? I guess maybe to put it in really face value terms, I want more (much more) smart multi-modal content (written, audio, video) content that is shorter than a book, but longer than twitter posts which teach me stuff - and which give me an ‘aha’ moment. I had a really life changing experience (documented well elsewhere) of where an aha moment from this kind of content did change my life.</p>
      <p>I want more of it, I want more great content that alters my mental model(s) of things. At the moment I use Youtube, Substack (but only occasionally) a range of habitual podcasts and other places to do this.</p>  
      <p>I suppose when I really try and empty my brain and understand what I'm doing here, I can't really (yet at least) define it in brick or no-brick absolutes. Its more of a spectrum. One that will improve over time. On one end of that spectrum sits the idea that there is no smart content (no content at all, perhaps) for people. No aha moments, no bits of information distributed to them that are potentially life changing. On the other end of that spectrum, is the possibility there is more life changing blogs, podcasts, videos than one could ever consume. More ideas, opportunities, etc. than we could ever realistically take-up. Perhaps despite what people think that with the internet allowing for the ubiquity of information, I think we're still on the former side of that spectrum. The underlying mission of Interesting Or Not is to bring us to the other side of that spectrum. You have every blog, podcast, (one day video) that you could ever dream or wish for. And its made by something that you feel intuitively gets you and what your interested in and about.</p>
      <p>The real endpoint of AI is a long way off. Sketching at least analytically in my own head what it means for Interesting Or Not is important though. It helps me, and I hope you, understand how far I can take the mission of Interesting Or Not: to give more people those 'aha' moments where two nodes in their mental model of the world (or maybe even one day the physical world) connect. And, from then on they are stronger and more powerful. They are something they weren't yesterday. If we could have more of that, more of the time, we might all just a bit richer.</p>

          <h2>What is the vision for Interesting Or Not?</h2>
          <p>When I was 21 I was working in politics, and with politics comes the media.</p>
          <p>At that time though I was reading lots of blogs. The authors of those blogs were the smartest people that I had come across. In some wordly (and perhaps indefinable) sense they were much smarter than the people at university. That's besides the point, though. Much smarter than traditional newspaper columnists, too. Slate Star Codex, Tim Gowers, Dominic Cummings, Steve Hsu, LessWrong, Paul Graham were just some. It was like unearthing the secret of where all the smart people were.</p>
          <p>I could also see that politics was going south and pretty quickly. But I was interested in all these smart people who were keen to solve hard problems and build cool things, unlike the vast majority of politicians.</p> 
          <p>I also thought it was pretty odd that most people had never heard of these smart people, yet they had heard of all the newspaper columnists who by comparison were fools simply spreading the latest popular meme.</p>
          <p>So, I wrote to one of them on their Substack, and asked for advice. They replied and said (with great foresight for 2020) that I should learn to code, and work on cool projects that I find interesting. At the time this seemed like fairly abstract advice, but I did it, nonetheless. </p>
          <p>So I learned to code did a few of my own projects, and sometime after I got interested in startups. Their blog, their writing, and them responding to me on their blog gave me an 'aha' moment that changed my life. </p>
          <p>I started my startup in July 2024. I wanted more people to have more great content, like the blog that gave me an 'aha' moment, and meant that I'd learn to code, get interested in startups, and ultimately change my course.</p>
          <p>For a while, I thought that meant well we should make it easier for as many people as possible to write, earn, and get reach for their content.</p>
          <p>That as a hypothesis though had a few fundamental issues. The first problem you might call the 'cold start' problem. Why do I want to be the first person to read - let alone pay for - the first piece of writing someone has done? And, will they actually be any good the first time around? It's probably just a truth that you can't hack the adoption curve of things, no matter how hard you try.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and perhaps above all else, there was a big elephant in the room - AI. LLMs seemed to dominate startup discussion. I'd always had in my head that I was betting on the human experience, and the human capacity to write great stuff, and against LLMs. I knew it was a risk.</p>
          <p>The funny thing was that when I first got people using the platform they used LLMs to write things. And at this time, we saw a steep improvement, with o1-mini, o1, Deepseek's R1, and o3-mini.</p>
          <p>So I thought what if you could create AI-personas that could write like humans, but were smarter and faster to adapt. This seemed to have several benefits that my old model about how to solve the problem fell short on:</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>More content that was better smarter and faster to adapt what readers want</li>
            <li>Larger profit margins. We'd no longer have to pay out 80% of our reader revenue to writers. That, from a financial standpoint, was a huge win.</li>
            <li>Multimodality, all of a sudden, what went from a 'writing platform' went to a platform that could have writers, artists, video creators and more. The only limtiation is the AI.</li>
            <li>Agency: more writers (or indeed content creators) that can do more things more quickly. We can have content creators that can do things far beyond just writing. What about having an AI doing real human interviews and more of them - and what if they could organise it all by themself. That is the potential.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So if you were to ask me 'what is the vision for Interesting Or Not?', I guess I would respond with this: the place where more people are able to have their 'aha' moments more of the time by distilling the knowledge and wisdom of people and ideas for them.</p>
         <p>What that menans in concrete terms is the place where AI agents write the 'everything magazine', where you have every blog or video or podcast that you ever wanted to read watch or listen to - or perhaps didn't even know you wanted. That is the promise of Interesting Or Not.</p>

          <h2>Extropy and why I like it</h2>
          <p>I really like the idea that physical word is, fundamentally, entropic. That when we reduce the physical world down to its
            
            The reduced physical disposition of things is that they are disposed to, rot, decay and decline. And, it is only humans, being the only intelligent lifeform we know of (so far), that is capable of pushing back on entropy. I find it a humbling idea. That the universe is indifferent to us, but we are not indifferent to it, and that if anything we have a duty to each other to maybe make it just a little bit less chaotic.</p>

          <p>Something that has been popularised on X recently is the idea of extropianism. I like this idea, the philosophy of reducing entropy where can, or the continuous drive for human improvement. Some might call it whiggism for the 21st century. Maybe that’s because whiggism - if you’re not a nihilist at least - always had a grain of truth to it, or maybe, at the very least, it captured humanities desire and spirit for adventure.</p>
          
          <p></p>So that is the philosophy I want to base my future endeavours around if I’m successful with Interesting Or Not. I think there is an argument that Interesting Or Not is - imperfectly - already based around that. I’d need to think about that more thought.</p>
          
          <p>I think that it’s useful to have this kind of underpinning philosophy. To have some form of intellectual underpinning to what you are doing. Elon Musk often talks about humanity is like a flickering candle in the wind, and if we’re not careful, it could go out. And, for him, that is why sustainable transportation, energy, free speech, and, ultimately, interplanetary space travel are so necessary. Cynics (and communists for that matter) argue that moral rationalisation of sociopathy etc. Regardless, if we do get effective interplanetary space travel, that is some kind of win.</p>
          
          <p>I think the idea of extropy provides a wellspring of ideas. One I’ve had recently is self-healing materials. This tackles the issue at its perhaps very most fundamental level, and if we can crack self-healing materials, then that is a great start. Think, what if potholes in roads could heal themselves. This suddenly removes all sorts of entropic forces otherwise at work. Citizens are unburdended from taxation going towards fixing them, drivers no longer have to mend cracked rims, and we all ride on smooth surfaces.</p>
          
          <p>The boundaries of it are near-on limitless. Think a laptop or iPhone that lasts if not for much much longer that your current one, if not forever. Self-healing furniture. Paint that touches itself back up when you scratch it. We start to create a world that aligns with our anti-entropic and indeed biological intuitions.</p>

          <h2>Digital Minimalism</h2>
          <b>Here is something I wrote back in October 2021 about Digital Minimalism. I would express the concern differently now, but still agree with the sentiment, though.</b>
          
          <p>I’ve been doing some thinking about my use of tech. i.e. how much and how often. There are a number of elements to this that I have thought about - some more than others. At the forefront though, is this: what’s wrong with using tech too much?  It connects us more-so than ever. Yes, that's right. But the core concern is that we are no longer using them intelligently; we are no longer using technology for a clear defined beneficial purpose. And, I don’t just mean for economic gain.</p>
          
          <p>The relationship that we have with phones/laptops etc is not analogous to that of other tools - which we might think to be asymmetrical in the sense that we control it. Our relationship with electronic technology is symmetrical - whilst we control it, the technology also controls us and our behaviour. That is hugely problematic and something that is well worth considering before using it like we do other tools.</p>
            
          <p>Social media is the best example of this. It is an entity that is now so skewed against the users that it purports to benefit that any rational person should question what benefit it serves them as an individual. The dopamine feedback loop. That is, as I understand (on a very cursory and superficial level) what makes picking up our devices - at any time of the day - so irresistible. Have a spare five minutes in the waiting room? I could check for notifications and updates! A half-an-hour train journey to kill? I could watch a tonne of YouTube, like all of my friends' social media posts and ten minutes left to respond to e-mails and messages. But are we doing this through our own volition and, if we are, does it actually boost our mood or make us happy? I would posit that it does not.</p>
            
          <p>Social media is a compilation of other people’s best moments. With one saving grace: you can put your own hat in the ring and demonstrate that yours are better than theirs - the ultimate keeping up with the Jones’s. Now, all of this might be fine if you have a pretty watertight ego and a good proclivity towards self-comparison, but if you don’t then the very best of luck. But it is no longer as analogue as the sharing of messages and comments. We can share images, videos and even track the location of others - even now demonstrating that ‘my current location is better than yours!’ The greatest bit about all of this is that we are self-decided into acting in this way.</p>
            
          <p>So, why not leave the rat-race? Pack it all in and go analogue. This is the second thread of thinking that I’ve had - how can this be practical? Will all of it not require an element of pragmatism - recognising the costs and benefits and trying to limit any costs? For instance, you can’t get Google Maps, WhatsApp, Apple Music etc on a Nokia flip phone and all of these applications are inseparable accoutrements of modern day living. And, this is the real difficulty when considering the issue of practicality. How can we reconcile the modern relationship with technology - which presupposes a trajectory towards acquiring more tech rather than getting rid of it - with actually having it for the sake of benefit rather than for the sake of having it. The point is this: how can you do it without becoming a person who is on the fringe - a troglodyte if you will.</p>
            
          <p>I would, however, emphasise an extremely important auxiliary point, which is that I’m not anti-technology. Far from it. I’m an enormous proponent of it. We should recognise the capacity for prosperity and progress that it brings. The current technology that we have at hand is incomparable in its potential when compared with the printing press. We need to push fields like data-science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and other such fields which are all still in their relative infancy. Such fledgling areas have the capacity to alter the relationship between humanity and notions of ‘knowledge’ and ‘understanding’. Almost an Enlightenment 2.0, if you will.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to my Blog!</h2>
        <b>29th June 2024: Interesting or not</b>
        <p>
          News should give you information that is on the frontiers of knowledge (what’s going to be useful tomorrow) and events, but it doesn’t do that.<br>
          Spam filters tell us what emails (text) are spam or not (and they give it a score accordingly). But what if you trained a spam filter (text classifier) on every idea that has ever been had?<br>
          What if you then ran every new news article through it? You can then tell how much every new idea and event is like those that went before, and specifically which ones.<br>
