        <H2>Digital Minimalism</H2>
        <b>Here is something I wrote back in October 2021 about Digital Minimalism. I would express the concern differently now, but still agree with the sentiment, though.</b>
        
        <p>I’ve recently been doing some thinking, and writing, on reducing my personal use of technology. There have been a number of different elements to this that I’ve thought about - some more than others. Perhaps at the forefront of those considerations is the following thought: well why? What’s wrong with technology right?  It connects us and brings us closer etc. than ever before. Well, yes, all such propositions are right. But the core of my concern is that - unlike other tools - we are no longer using them intelligently; we are no longer using technology for a clear defined beneficial purpose. And, I don’t just mean for economic gain.</p>
        
        <p> The relationship that we have phones/laptops etc is not analogous to that of other tools - which we might think to be asymmetrical in the sense that we control it. Our relationship with electronic technology is symmetrical - whilst we control it, the technology also controls us and our behaviour.  That is hugely problematic and something that is well worth considering before using it like we do other tools.</p>
          
        <p> Social media is the best example of this. It is an entity that is now so skewed against the users that it purports to benefit that any rational person should question what benefit it serves them as an individual. The dopamine feedback loop. That is, as I understand (on a very cursory and superficial level) what makes picking up our devices - at any time of the day - so irresistible. Have a spare five minutes in the waiting room? I could check for notifications and updates! A half-an-hour train journey to kill? I could watch a tonne of YouTube, like all of my friends social media posts and ten minutes left to respond to e-mails and messages. But are we doing this through our own volition and, if we are, does it actually boost our mood or make us happy? I would posit that it does not.</p>
          
        <p> Social media is a compilation of other people’s best moments. With one saving grace: you can put your own hat in the ring and demonstrate that your’s are better than theirs’ - the ultimate keeping up with the Jones’s. Now, all of this might be fine if you have a pretty watertight ego and reasonably good proclivity towards self-comparison, but if you don’t then the very best of luck. But, it is no longer as analogue as the sharing of messages and comments. We can share images, videos and even track the location of others - even now demonstrating that ‘my current location is better than yours!’ The greatest bit about all of this is that we are self-decided into acting in this way.</p>
          
        <p> So, why not leave the rat-race? Pack it all in and go analogue. This is the second thread of thinking that I’ve had - how can this be practical? Will all of it not require an element of pragmatism - recognising the costs and benefits and trying to limit any costs? For instance, you can’t get Google Maps, WhatsApp, Apple Music etc on a Nokia flip phone and all of these applications are inseparable accoutrements of modern day living. And, this is the real difficulty when considering the issue of practicality. How can we reconcile the modern relationship with technology - which presupposes a trajectory towards acquiring more tech  rather than getting rid of it - with actually having it for the sake of benefit rather than for the sake of having it. The point is this: how can you do it without becoming a person who is on the fringe - a troglodyte if you will.</p>
          
        <p>I would, however, emphasise an extremely important auxiliary point, which is that I’m not anti-technology. Furtherest thing from it. I’m an enormous proponent of it. We should recognise the capacity for prosperity and progress that it brings. The current technology that we have at hand is incomparable in its potential when compared with the printing press. We need to push fields like data-science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and other such fields which are all still in their relative infancy. Such fledgling areas have the capacity to alter the relationship between humanity and notions of ‘knowledge’ and ‘understanding’. Almost an Enlightenment 2.0 if you will. </p>

  <b>29th June 2024: Interesting or not</b>
      <p>
News should give you information that is on the frontiers of knowledge (what’s going to be useful tomorrow) and events, but it doesn’t do that.<br>

Spam filters, tell us what emails (text) are spam or not (and they give it a score accordingly).  But what if you trained a spam filter (text classifier) on every idea that has ever been had?<br>

What if you then ran every new news article through it?  You can then tell how much every new idea and event is like those that went before, and specifically which ones.  <br>
