      <p>Most people now agree that AI is going to bring a step-change to human existence. It’s easy to see why.<sup>
        <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>
      </sup> In grand terms, there is a digital version of intelligence that can not only communicate, but also generate information at a lower latency than humans. And the kicker is that it can do it in natural language. Intelligence, then, is going to be distributed as far as we can take it, or maybe even as far as it can take itself. What is less clear is that the way we create and share ideas will change too. Here is why. </p>
      <p>
        To start, we need to go back to the invention of the printing press. It marks perhaps the single most pivotal event in human history.<sup>
            <a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a>
          </sup>. What the printing press enabled was the first real means of sharing information at scale beyond a tribe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Not long after its invention, people worked out how to mechanise its output, so that what was printed could be spread at scale beyond the previous method of scribes. That breakthrough unlocked mass communication. No longer bound by the scribes, information cascaded in days, not decades.

        Not long after its invention, people worked out how to mechanise its output, so that what was printed could be spread at scale beyond the previous method of scribes. That breakthrough unlocked mass communication. No longer bound by the scribes, information cascaded in days, not decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after that, organisations emerged that didn’t just reprint existing books but instead published information about events in their local village, town, and city. These are what we now call newspapers, and from that moment everyone’s ‘tribe’ grew.<sup>
            <a href="#f31" id="ref3">3</a>
          </sup>.       
    </p>
    <p>
        This new type of organisation worked out two important things. First, how to gather information in a decentralised way beyond what any one author could collate in a book. Second, how to share that information with people who actually cared about it. The only way to do that was at scale with the new printing press. 
        </p>
          <p>
            The very newspapers - gazettes - were handwritten records of wars and political events at the time. A step towards decentralisation was made though. If you employ lots of reporters, investigators and writers, then you can cover much more in greater detail than any one writer. And if you get presses to print what was created, you can print far more than any team of scribes to create. The hive mind was therefore scaled for the first time in some real sense. Information could be spread beyond the scale of word of mouth, or sharing information on parchment. For nearly four centuries, that “hive-mind” model stayed remarkably stable: centralised presses gathering facts, filtering them, then broadcasting to the masses.
          </p>
          <p>
            For most of the internet’s existence the model that has evolved from the 1560s onwards has changed very little. What the internet has done is to lower latency and improve ease of access to what is printed. Instead of going to a corner-shop and buying the print, you can go on your phone and read it. Perhaps it’s to be expected that the internet wouldn’t change the newspaper model. Much of what the internet initially did was decrease latency and increase ease-of-access to knowledge. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The true paradigm shift arrived not with another website, but with a new social protocol - Twitter. It took until the creation of Twitter in 2006 for that reinvention to kick off. Twitter changed not just the type of information that we share, but the way in which we share it. It takes decentralisation to its limit. Instead of a group of investigators, journalists and writers sharing updates about the world, you or me can share updates about our world. It’s a stunningly simple idea: personal status updates that you can send to everyone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What you gain in increased decentralisation and granularity, you trade in quality, length, detail, and thoughtfulness. In many cases the trade-off is one worth paying, but not in all. What I write here in an essay is (hopefully) more interesting and thoughtful than my last tweet about a pretty cottage I saw. Twitter’s 280-character shorthand became ubiquitous, but many wanted a space that combined its openness with more room for reflection. That tension set the stage for what came next.
             </p>
             <p>
                Just over a decade later the creators of Substack realised that there was value in synthesising the old model adopted by newspapers and the new model adopted by Twitter. Let anyone publish, but incentivise them to do it in long-form. A number of blogging platforms (Blogger, Posterous, Posthaven, Wordpress) managed to let this model pass them by. It was the first platform that tried to reconcile the old system with the new. Let decentralise readers write content and get their readers to pay for it. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        This reconciliation and the permutation of it that Substack adopted had tradeoffs too, though. Do you as a reader want to pay £9.99 a month for each writer you like? It quickly adds up, and plays into Twitter’s hands by artificially limiting the volume of content available to readers. The old system of newspapers and magazines retained their dominance as a result. Pay £9.99 to the old system and get lots of articles from lots of writers. Substack proved there was appetite for decentralised, reader-funded essays - but it still asked writers to do heavy lifting. What if the technology itself could shoulder more of the burden?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many see our age as one of declining literacy rates. I disagree, or rather I disagree that it has to be that. The problem is the difference in volume, which takes decentralisation to its limit caused. Most people can’t write articles in the same volume that they can write 280 character tweets. What does that end up meaning? Tweets capture our attention and long-form stuff doesn’t. There’s simply not enough spare intelligence to write the long-form stuff. 
                                        </p>

                                        This is why the promise of AI is exciting. Technology can place decentralised long-form content on a par with short-form content. This learns and improves on the lessons from each different iteration of the model. 
                                    </p>

                                </p>

                                This is where the model of Polyspark comes in - and why it really excites me. Large language models provide the opportunity to synthesise the learnings of the centralised and decentralised models, and for the first time, remove their trade-offs. Large-language models with memory, access to multi-modal inputs, present the opportunity to enable the same level of decentralised granularity as Twitter whilst also enabling the quality and thoughtfulness once reserved only for centralised dissemination. At the same time it removes the responsibility placed onto the reader by models like Substack to verify for themselves (and with their own money) that what writers are doing is actually good and worth paying for. 
                                                        </p>
                                                    </p>


                                                    The arc is clear: every advance lowered barriers but forced trade-offs - until now. AI doesn’t just push faster distribution; it holds the promise of distributing genuinely thoughtful ideas at scale. Polyspark is our first real glimpse of that future—and it shows that the next chapter in our information story will finally blend speed, depth, and personalisation into one model.
                                                </p>
