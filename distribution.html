    <main>
      <p>Most now agree that AI is going to bring a step-change to human existence. It’s easy to see why.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>
      </sup> In grand terms, there is a digital version of intelligence that can not only communicate, but also generate information at a lower latency than humans. And the kicker is that it can do it in natural language. Intelligence, then, is going to be distributed as far as we can take it, or maybe even as far as it can take itself. What is less clear, though, is that the way we create and share ideas will change too. Here is why.</p>
      <p>To start, we need to go back to the invention of the printing press. It marks perhaps the single most pivotal event in human history.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> What the printing press enabled was the first real means of sharing information at scale, beyond a tribe.</p>
      <p>Not long after its invention, people worked out how to mechanise its output, so that what was printed could be spread at scale beyond the previous method of scribes. That breakthrough unlocked mass communication. No longer bound by the scribes, information spread in days, not decades. After that, organisations emerged that didn’t just reprint existing books but published information about what was going on in the world far beyond any one individual.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>        </p>
      <p>This new type of organisation worked out two important things. First, how to gather information in a decentralised way beyond what any one author could collate in a book. Second, how to share that information with people who actually cared about it. The only way to do that was at scale with the new printing press.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></p></sup>  
      <p>The very first newspapers - gazettes - were handwritten records of wars and political events, often written by a sole author. If you employ a team of journalists, investigators, and writers, you can cover much more ground in much more detail. Couple that with the printing press, then you far exceed what was possible beforehand under teams of monastic scribes. The hive mind was therefore scaled for the first time in some real sense. Information could be spread beyond the scale of word of mouth, or sharing information on parchment. For nearly four centuries, that “hive-mind” model stayed remarkably stable: centralised presses gathering facts, filtering them, then broadcasting to the masses.</p>
      <p>For most of the internet’s existence the model that has evolved from the first newspaper in the 1560s onwards has changed very little. What the internet has done is to lower latency and improve ease of access to what is written. Instead of going to a corner-shop and buying the print, you can go on your phone and read it. Perhaps it’s to be expected that the internet wouldn’t change the newspaper model. Much of the internet’s impact can be explained in terms of how it has reduced the time it takes for information to pass from one person to another.</p>
      <p>The true paradigm shift arrived not with another website, but with a new social protocol - Twitter.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Twitter’s invention in 2006 changed not just the type of information that we share, but the way in which we share it. It takes decentralisation to its limit. Instead of a group of investigators, journalists and writers sharing updates about the world, you or me can share updates about our world - what we are doing. It’s a stunningly simple idea: personal status updates that you can send to everyone.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></p>
      <p>What you gain in decentralisation, you trade in quality, length, detail, and thoughtfulness. In many cases the trade-off is one worth paying, but not in all. What I write here in an essay is (hopefully) more interesting and thoughtful than the last tweet I posted. Hopefully this essay sticks around longer with you than a tweet. Whilst Twitter had become ubiquitous, long-form content beyond the old newspapers and publications had not. That tension between the ever-presence of shorthand thought which Twitter provided and the lack of any new platform for longer content, set the stage for what came next.</p>
      <p>The creators of Substack realised this, just over a decade after Twitter was launched. Value lay in bringing together the old model that newspapers had adopted and the new model which Twitter iterated to. Let anyone publish, but incentivise them to do it in long-form. A number of blogging platforms (Blogger, Posterous, Posthaven, Wordpress) managed to let this model pass them by. It was the first platform that tried to reconcile the old system with the new. Let decentralised writers write content and get their readers to pay for it.</p>
      <p>Substack’s bringing together of the old two models in this way had tradeoffs too, though. Do you as a reader want to pay £9.99 a month for each writer you like? It adds up quickly. Not only that, but into Twitter’s hands by artificially constraining supply by limiting the volume of content available to readers. The old system of newspapers and magazines retained their dominance as a result. Pay £9.99 to the old system and get lots of articles from lots of writers. What Substack did do successfully, though, was to prove that an appetite for decentralised reader-funded essays did exist.</p>
      <p>The case that the current age is a doom-loop of AI slop, mindless Tik-Tok reels, and declining literacy rates is maybe well founded. It lacks ambition for our times, however. That’s why I disagree that this is what our age has to be or should be. It should be something very different, a new renaissance.</p>                                   
      <p>Platforms like Substack have so far failed to tackle decentralisation whilst providing an experience that is on a par to short-form platforms. This in many ways is unsurprising and a result of the constraints of technology. Decentralising publication pushes content creation in the direction of lower quality and shorter formats. TV companies have more resources than TikTok creators, and newspapers have more resources than most Substackers. Most people can’t write articles in the same volume that they can write 280 character tweets.</p>
      <p>What does this mean, though? Supply of short-form content like Tweets and reels are in far greater supply and volume than truly brilliant long-form content. It’s not that people don’t want long-form content, they do. Instead it’s just that there isn’t enough of it for them to consume, so the 280 character tweets win the competition for their attention. What the real takeaway is though is that up until now, there hasn’t been enough intelligence to write great long-form content.</p>
      <p>The promise of AI means that for the first time there will be enough intelligence, however. Technology is the great enabler and now it can place long-form content on a par with short-form content, or instead give it a real run for its money. It presents a real opportunity to learn from the previous models and systems of idea distribution and iterate towards a new better one.</p>
      <p>This is what Polyspark is. The thing that is iterating us towards that new model with a new system. Check it out here: <a href="https://www.readpolyspark.com" id="polyspark">www.readpolyspark.com</a></p>
      <p>The arc is clear then. Every advance so far lowered barriers to the transmission of ideas, but forced trade-offs. There is now an opportunity to advance the way we share ideas further, but hopefully with fewer tradeoffs. Polyspark is a glimpse of that future—and hopefully it shows that the next chapter in the information story can resolve some of the problems with the previous way of sharing information.</p>

        After five days, ChatGPT acquired 1 million users, 100 million after two months, half-a-billion by March 2025, and is now the fifth most visited site in the world.

        The creation of language itself and its transmission might be more important, but the competition is tight. Language is the precursor that enabled the printing press, but the printing press was the thing that scaled language. An analogous argument is: was the microprocessor or the computer more important? One enabled the other, but without the microprocessor there wouldn’t be any computer.
        Language created an unscalable means of transmitting thought, and the printing press was the first real attempt to scale thoughts and ideas.<a href="#ref2" class="backref">↩︎</a>

        Whilst it took some time for the practical build-out of printing presses, the conceptual break with scribes was sudden. People understood quickly that what would take a scribe several hours and days to produce would be produced substantially quicker by a printing press. What’s more, the practical build-out of presses meant that monastic scribes stuck around for several decades after the presses’ invention.<a href="#ref3" class="backref">↩︎</a>

        Curiously the first newspapers were only established at the mid-point between printing presses being invented and them becoming dominant over scribes. The first circulated newspaper was in Venice in 1566.<a href="#ref4" class="backref">↩︎</a>
      </li>
      <li id="fn5">Blogs were the precursor to this, but Twitter represented what Paul Graham calls a “change in protocol” where the author no longer specifies the recipients.<a href="#ref5" class="backref">↩︎</a></li>
      <li id="fn6">In fact, Twitter’s initial idea (SMS updates) was mocked as trivial and silly, but soon caught on.<a href="#ref6" class="backref">↩︎</a></li>
