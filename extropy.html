        <h2>Extropy and why I like it</h2>
<p>A mental heuristic I find useful is the concept of entropy. 
  
  As a heuristic guide, I find useful the idea that the physical word is entropic. That at a reductionist level, the world is chaotic, and that systems left to themselves cannot decrease in entropy. It is, instead, only humans, through intelligence and rationality, acting as an organising force, that can alter the system to decrease entropy.</p>
  
  <p>The reduced physical disposition of things is that they are disposed to, rot, decay and decline. And, it is only humans, being the only intelligent lifeform we know of (so far), that is capable of pushing back on entropy. I find it a humbling idea. That the universe is indifferent to us, but we are not indifferent to it, and that if anything we have a duty to each other to maybe make it just a little bit less chaotic.</p>

<p>Something that has been popularised on X recently is the idea of extropianism. I like this idea, the philosophy of reducing entropy where we can, or the continuous drive for human improvement. Some might call it whiggism for the 21st century. Maybe that’s because whiggism - if you’re not a nihilist at least - always had a grain of truth to it, or maybe, at the very least, it captured humanities desire and spirit for adventure.</p>


<p>I think that it’s useful to have this kind of underpinning philosophy. To have some form of intellectual underpinning to what you are doing. Elon Musk often talks about humanity is like a flickering candle in the wind, and if we’re not careful, it could go out. And, for him, that is why sustainable transportation, energy, free speech, and, ultimately, interplanetary space travel are so necessary. Cynics (and communists for that matter) argue that moral rationalisation of sociopathy etc. Regardless, if we do get effective interplanetary space travel, that is some kind of win.</p>

<p>I think the idea of extropy provides a wellspring of ideas. One I’ve had recently is self-healing materials. This tackles the issue at its perhaps very most fundamental level, and if we can crack self-healing materials, then that is a great start. Think, what if potholes in roads could heal themselves. This suddenly removes all sorts of entropic forces otherwise at work. Citizens are unburdended from taxation going towards fixing them, drivers no longer have to mend cracked rims, and we all ride on smooth surfaces.</p>

<p>The boundaries of it are near-on limitless. Think a laptop or iPhone that lasts if not for much much longer that your current one, if not forever. Self-healing furniture. Paint that touches itself back up when you scratch it. We start to create a world that aligns with our anti-entropic and indeed biological intuitions.</p>
