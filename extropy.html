        A mental heuristic I find useful is the concept of entropy. At a
        reductionist level, the world is chaotic—systems left to themselves
        cannot decrease entropy. Only humans, through intelligence and
        rationality, act as an organizing force to push back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things tend to rot, decay, and decline. It’s humbling: the universe is
        indifferent, but we’re not. We have a duty to each other to make our
        corner of the world a little less chaotic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently on X I saw extropianism defined as the continuous drive for
        human improvement—reducing entropy wherever we can. In a sense,
        whiggism for the 21st century: celebrating progress, adventure, and
        the belief that we can push forward.
      </p>

        Elon Musk likens humanity to a flickering candle in the wind. To him,
        that’s why sustainable energy, free speech, and interplanetary travel
        matter. Critics may scoff, but if we crack effective spaceflight,
        that’s a win for extropy.
      </p>

        One inspiring idea is self-healing materials. Imagine potholes that
        fix themselves—no more road tax hikes, no more cracked rims, just
        smooth roads. Self-repairing phones, furniture, paint that mends its
        scratches… a world aligned with our anti-entropic drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The possibilities are near-limitless. A laptop that lasts decades or
        forever, homes that maintain themselves, infrastructure that never
        fails. Extropy offers the philosophical wellspring for engineering a
        world that fights back against decay—and powers our next great leaps.
